[Chorus] ## TheSimpsons ## [Bell Ringing] [Whistle Blowing] [ Beeping ] [Jazzy Solo ] [ Beeping ] [ Tires Screeching ] D'oh! [ Screams ] - Well, children, it's the last day of school.
- [ All ] Yea! Here are your grades.
Oh, no, Mrs.
Krabappel.
If I don't get a "C" average, my dad won't let me go to Kamp Krusty.
Well, it isn't fair to the other children, but all right.
- Much obliged, doll! - [ Laughing ] Oh, Bart Simpson, I'm gonna miss you.
Attention, everyone.
This is Principal Skinner.
I trust you all remembered to bring in your implements of destruction.
[Skinner] Now, let's trash this dump.
[Rock] Somebody put a torch to these permanent records.
Quickly, now.
[ Vocalizing ] - ## [ Continues ] - Wake up, boy.
[ Groans, Gasps ] I dreamt it was the last day of school.
Well, it is.
Oh, how do I know this isn't Some beautiful dream too? Ow! You know, a pinch is more traditional.
[ Loud Gobbling, Belching ] Homer, you do remember your promise to the children? Sure do! When you're 1 8, you're out the door! No, Dad, you promised if Bart and I got "C" averages, we could go to Kamp Krusty.
And with no false modesty, you're lookin' at one happy camper.
[ Nervous Chuckling ] Yeah.
Remember, when you see my report card, they got this new grading system this year.
It now goes, "D," "B," "A," "C.
" Listen, boy, we have an understanding, and you'd better keep your end of it.
I don't think I'd be any kind of a father If you got D's, and I let you go to Kamp Krusty.
But, Dad! if you want something in this life, you have to work for it.
Now, quiet! They're about to announce the lottery numbers.
- [ Man ] Seventeen, 32-- - D'oh! - five-- - D'oh! - eight-- - Whoo-hoo! - 47.
- D'oh! [Skinner On P.
A.
] Attention, students.
Please clear out your lockers into the waste baskets provided.
Thirty-six, 24, 36.
Ha, ha, ha.
- [ Cracks Knuckles ] - Now, let's see what we got here.
Ah, my gym shorts.
Here are your final report cards.
I have nothing left to say to any of you.
So if nobody minds, let's just quietly run out the clock.
[ Gasps ] I've never gotten a "B" before.
How could this have happened? I feel so dirty! [ Grunting ] The dirt's not coming off!.
[ Panting ] Okay.
Calm down.
This must just be a little typo.
[ Nervous Giggle ] Oh, Miss Hoover! There appears to be a mistake on my report card.
You gave me a B-plus in conduct? Now, Lisa, everyone needs a blotch on their permanent record.
Perhaps I'm not making myself clear.
[ Hysterical Giggle ] - I think you should reconsider.
- Lisa, you're hurting me! Mrs.
Krabappel, in figuring out my final grades I hope you'll note that all Of my textbooks are being returned in excellent condition-- in some cases, still in their original wrappings.
Duly noted.
I'd also like to add, as I gaze upon your beauty I've never seen an angel fly so low.
Forget it, short pants.
Mrs.
Krabappel, if I don't get at least a "C" average I can't go to Kamp Krusty! Have a "D"-lightful summer! [ Laughing ] - Five! - Four! - Three! - Two! - Don't open your mouth.
- One! - [Bell Ringing] [ Cheering ] Wait a minute! You didn't learn how World War I ended.
- We won! - Yea! U.
S.
A! U.
S.
A! U.
S.
A! U.
S.
A! I haven't seen such unfettered hurly-burly since the fall of Saigon.
Well, William, another school year gone by.
- And may I say, a job well done, sir? - Well, back to work then.
Make sure to give those toilets a good scrubbing.
We want the old girls sparkling when I get back.
Aye, sir.
Eh, you silk-wearing buttercup! All right! Three whole months Of Spaghetti Os and daytime TV! So, Bart, will you be joining me in the bucolic splendor of Kamp Krusty? You bet.
Check out this hand.
All aces.
[ Laughing ] A-plus! Oh, Bart, why didn't you at least forge plausible grades? [ Sighing ] Oh! Hi, kids! Only one week left to sign up for the bestest summer ever at Kamp Krusty! [ Grunts, Laughing ] Whoa! [ Laughing, Grunting ] Hey! Kamp Krusty is built on an actual Indian burial ground.
We've got archery, wallet-making-- the whole megillah.
[Chortling] And for you fat kids my exclusive program of diet and ridicule will really get results.
And the best part is, when you come to Kamp Krusty you'll spend the summer with me! Honest Injun! [ Chortling ] Well, here goes nothin'.
- [Clattering] - D'oh! Stupid roller skate.
Well, Dad, here's my report card.
I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.
A-plus? - You don't think much of me, do you, boy? - No, sir.
You know, a "D" turns into a "B" so easily.
You just got greedy.
So I won't get to go to camp? Now, Bart, we made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades.
And you didn't.
But why should you pay for my mistake? - You mean I can go? - Yeah.
I didn't want you hanging around all summer anyway.
Oh, Dad, you're the best father a boy could ever have! Thanks, son.
Now, you've got little hands.
Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate? - [ Engine Starts ] - Phew.
Never mind.
[ Humming ] Bart, where's your bathing suit? - I'm gonna swim "nekkid.
" - You're what? Ah, sure, there'll be a couple Of up-tight counselors who won't dig the Bart philosophy but I feel the human body is a thing of beauty.
Marge, am I crazy or is my back getting hairier? Before I go to camp, I'll need boosters for malaria German measles, encephalitis, Hansen's disease-- Oh, now, I'm afraid what we have here is an advanced case of hypochondria.
There's only one known cure-- a "wowwipop.
" [ Chuckling ] Don't patronize me, Doctor.
It's our last family dinner for six weeks but I promised myself I wouldn't cry.
[ Loud Gulping, Snorting ] [ Sobbing ] Oh, I'm going to miss this! [ Sniffles ] Hey, hands off my pickle! - I don't see your name on it, boy.
- No, but-- Oh, yeah? Check mate! Always thinking two moves ahead.
We'll see you when you get back from Image Enhancement Camp.
Spare me your euphemisms.
It's fat camp for Daddy's chubby little secret! You promised you wouldn't make a scene.
Mmm! [ Kissing ] Good-bye, my special little guy! Mmm! Mmm! Lisa, watch out for poison ivy.
Remember: leaves of three, let it be.
Leaves of four, eat some more.
[ Laughing ] - Good-bye.
Good-bye, sweetie.
- Good-bye, Mom.
- Bye, Dad! I'll write you every day! - Don't look in my closet.
In fact, stay out Of my room altogether.
[Lisa] If the pets die, don't replace them.
I'll know! [ All Cheering ] [Woman] So long! Don't come back! Hi, kids! Welcome to Kamp Krusty! [ Chortling ] I'll see you in a few weeks.
Until then, I've turned things over to my bestest buddy in the whole wide world-- [ Dubbed Voice ] Mr.
Black.
- I want you to treat-- - [Dubbed Voice]Mr.
Black.
with the same respect you would give me.
- Now here's-- - [ Dubbed Voice ] Mr.
Black.
Thank you, Krusty, and welcome, children.
I am Mr.
Black, your head counselor.
For the past 1 5 years, I was president of Euro-Krustyland until it blew up.
I'll take any questions you might have.
You, and then one more.
- Can we call you Uncle Blackie? - No.
Last question.
- When do we get to see Krusty? - Uh, he will be along eventually.
In the meantime, our counselors Dolph, Jimbo and Kearney will be happy to handle any problems you may have.
- [ Coughs ] - Looks like we got ourselves a troublemaker.
[ Grunting ] - [ Giggling ] - You can have the shower to yourself, Homie.
- I'm finished.
- Oh, no, you're not.
- Ohh! - [ Chuckling ] Here's your cabin.
If you don't like it, T.
S.
- [ Squawking ] - [ Gasping ] [ Rattling ] This is a little more rustic than I expected.
I'm not worried, Lise.
You know why? Because of this.
The Krusty Brand Seal of Approval.
You can only find it on products which meet the high personal standards of Krusty the Clown.
- Ow! - Oops.
I should've warned you.
That clock gets incredibly hot If you leave it plugged in.
That's okay.
Uh, all this stuff is fine.
[ Chortling ] Now I am off to Wimbledon! Don't we get to roast marshmallows? Shut up and eat your pinecone.
Uh, are you sure that's safe? Well, it ain't gettin' any safer.
[ All Gasping ] [Footsteps] All right, you balls of pan drippings! I want to see Crisco coming out of those pores! We're not leaving until this Christmas ham gives me a pull-up.
[ Acoustic Guitar] [ Singing ] Louder! Faster! -####[Continues] -[Grunts] - [Wood Creaking] - [ All Groaning ] - You're serving us gruel? - Not quite.
This is Krusty Brand Imitation Gruel.
Nine out of 1 0 orphans can't tell the difference.
- Yo, Mr.
Black.
Another brandy.
- Gentlemen, to evil.
Marge, since the kids left, I've lost five pounds! Oh, that's wonderful! And look-- new hair! I'm this close to having a comb-over.
- [ Purring ] - [ Giggling ] - [Laughing] - Oh! - [ Shuddering ] - Lights out, losers! Yeah, we're meetin' some tail on the other side of the lake.
[ Chuckling ] [Locks Sliding Shut] - I feel like I'm gonna die, Bart.
- We're all gonna die, Lise.
- I meant soon.
- So did I.
Mmm.
Strawberries.
Mmm.
[ Slurping ] Ah, that's good.
Hey, Lendl! Choke! Choke! Yeah! [ Man ] Point and game, Becker.
And will the harlequin in the third row Please keep his voice down? [ Chortles ] Sorry, folks.
- [ Grunts ] Sorry, Your Majesty.
- Hmph! [ Thinking ] Dear kids, I hope this letter finds you well.
We're doing great.
Your father is in the best shape he's been since-- well, ever! [ Grunts ] Strength! Agility! [Marge's Voice] We miss you terribly.
I hope these jelly bean cookies will tide you over until you get home.
Hey, Simpson! Tell your mom her cookies sucked.
[ Sighs ] [ Thinking ] Dear Mom and Dad, I no longer fear hell because I've been to Kamp Krusty.
Our nature hikes have become grim death marches.
[ Groans ] - A snake bit me.
- Back in line, maggot! [Lisa] Our arts and crafts center is, in actuality, a Dickensian workhouse.
Come on, wimps! These Gucci wallets have to be on the streets of Hong Kong by Friday.
[Lisa] Bart makes it through the days relying on his unwavering belief that Krusty the Clown will come through.
Krusty is coming.
Krusty is coming.
Krusty's coming.
But I am far more pessimistic.
I am not sure If this letter will reach you as our lines of communication have been cut.
Giddyap! Now the effort of writing Has made me lightheaded so I close by saying, "Save us! Save us now!'" - Bart and Lisa.
- [ Chuckling ] Ah, kids' letters from camp.
Oh, she complains now, but when we go to pick her up, she won't want to leave.
[Wind Howling] [Thunderclaps] Lisa, I've been thinking it over.
Next summer, I'm getting a job.
[ Moaning ] Oh, Homer.
It's getting late.
We'll miss the fireworks.
Marge, we've got all the fireworks we need right here.
Well, kids, I promised you a little treat in lieu of dinner and here it is-- the man who took an abandoned mule tannery and turned it into a summer wonderland Mr.
Krusty the Clown.
See? I told you Krusty would come.
just like I said.
He's gonna bring us food and water, and smite our enemies! [ Flies Buzzing ] Now, I must tell you kids, Krusty has laryngitis and a bad back so he won't be saying anything or doing anything.
Krusty looks fat.
He's really having trouble keeping his balance.
He's still funny, but not ha-ha funny.
- That's not Krusty the Clown! - [ Kids Gasping ] What do you think? I slapped a clown suit on some wino? - [ Nervous Laughing ] I mean, I-- - Yeah, Bart.
I am so Krunchy the Clown! [ Belches ] All right.
That's it.
I've been scorched by Krusty before.
I got a rapid heartbeat from those Krusty Brand vitamins.
My Krusty calculator didn't have a seven or an eight! And Krusty's autobiography was self-serving with many glaring omissions.
But this time, he's gone too far! We want Krusty! We want Krusty! We want Krusty! Yeah, we want Krunchy! We want Krunchy! - I thought you said you broke their spirits.
- We did.
- You broke nothing.
- [ Bart ] Let's get 'em! To the hydrofoil! [ All Clamoring ] My chunky brothers, gorge yourselves at the trough of freedom! - [ Cheering ] - [ Slurping ] Ahh! Sweet, nourishing gruel! - Kowalski! - My brownies! - Wiggum! - A change of underwear! - Crandall! - My insulin! [ Squeaking ] Bart! You said you were gonna name it Camp Freedom! Aah, this has more zing.
I dub thee Sir-- Urgent call for Mr.
Clown.
This better be important.
Oy, gevalt! just let your head flop back and forth.
Your neck is a well-cooked piece of asparagus.
[ Man On TV] We interrupt Sadrudin Mabaradad's Yoga Party for this special bulletin-- - "Krisis at Kamp Krusty.
" - [ Gasps ] Ladies and gentlemen, I've been to Vietnam, Afghanistan and Iraq and I can say without hyperbole that this is a million times worse than all of them put together.
[ Chanting ] Burn, Krusty, burn! Burn, Krusty, burn! A group of school-aged Spartacuses has taken this camp by force.
Three counselors are missing and presumed scared.
What's that? I'm being told I can have an exclusive interview with the ringleader.
[ Thinking ] Don't be the boy.
Don't be the boy.
D'oh! I just want the whole world to know that this was a really crappy camp.
- Can I say "crappy" on TV? - Yes, on this network, you can.
Is it true you attempted suicide when you heard the news? - Are you and Princess Di just friends? - You people make me sick! You're vultures! Where were you when I sang at Farm Aid? Out of my way, you parasites! I said, out of my way! I'm no fake.
I'm the real Krusty.
Oh, yeah? Who played your daughter in the short-lived sitcom President Clown? I don't know her name, but she held up a liquor store last year.
I smell bacon.
Let's see if he's wearing a wire! - Hey! Whoa! No! Not the face! - [ Gasping ] [Lisa] It is the real Krusty.
Look at that pacemaker scar, the cattle skull birthmark and his famous superfluous nipple.
At least you're not as bad as Customs.
How could you, Krusty? I'd never lend my name to an inferior product.
[ Loud Sobbing ] Oh! They drove a dump truck full Of money up to my house.
I'm not made of stone! Krusty, this camp was a nightmare.
They fed us gruel.
They forced us to make wallets for export.
And one of the campers was eaten by a bear.
Oh, my God! [ Sobbing ] - Well, actually, the bear just ate his hat.
- Was it a nice hat? - Oh, yeah.
- Oh, my God! I'm gonna make it up to you.
I'm gonna Show you kids the time of your life.

While directing Hats Off to Hanukkah I reduced more than one cast member to tears.

All right.
I'll pick up a bucket Of fried chicken, extra skin rolls, chocolate cream parfait-- - [ Gasps ] - Stop bothering my Blanche! Oh! I play an aging Southern beauty who's driven to insanity by her brutish brother-in-law, Stanley.
Wow! My mother the actress.
I feel like Lucie Arnaz Luckinbill.
Are there any jive-talking robots in this play? I don't think so.

Grr.
Aww, isn't that cute! And me without a camera.
Here.
My sister runs a day care center.
Hmm.
I guess a few weeks wouldn't hurt her.
Maggie is allergic To strained pears and she likes a bottle of warm milk before nap time.
A bottle? [ Laughs ] Mrs.
Simpson, do you know what a baby's saying when she reaches for a bottle? - "Ba-ba?" - She's saying, "I am a leech.
" Our aim here is to develop the bottle within.
That sounds awfully harsh.
Mrs.
Simpson, I don't like to toot my own horn but we're the only day care center in town that's not currently under investigation by the state.
Oh.
Well, be a good girl, Maggie.
I'm sorry, Maggie.
We don't allow these here.
You're a dame and I'm a fella Stanley, stop or I'll tell Stella Passion, Mrs.

I'm sorry, Llewellyn, I just-- I just don't see why Blanche should shove a broken bottle in Stanley's face.
Couldn't she just take his abuse with gentle good humor? Marge, your ride's here.
Homer, it'll just be a few minutes more! You're a dame and I'm a fella Stanley, stop or I'll tell Stella Marge.
Marge! I'm asking For white-hot rage and you're giving me a hissy fit.
Marge, can I get some change for the candy machine? - Oh, here! - [ Clattering ] Hey, there's some quarters in here.
I just don't see what's so bad about Stanley.
[ Grunting ] Stanley is thoughtless, violent and loud.
Marge, every second you spend with this man he is crushing your fragile spirit.
You can't let that happen.
[Yelling] Whoo-hoo! Come to papa.
Marge, I'll be out in the car.
All I want is one embrace - [Car Horn Honking] - Marge, move it or lose it.
I'll twist this bottle in your face Aaah! Hallelujah! I've done it again! Ned, you're supposed to overpower her.
I'm trying.
I'm trying.
[ Straining ] - Salt me.
- [ Southern Accent ] Here you are, Homer.
What the-- Why are you talking like that? The play's tomorrow night.
[ With Accent ] I've got to stay in character.
- [ With Accent ] Would it help if I talked like this too? - It might.
[ Cockney Accent ] An' I'll talk like 'is.
Bob's yer uncle, mate.
That really doesn't help, Bart.
Big Daddy, would y'all mind passin' a lil' ol' biscuit? Can I slog off school tomorrow? Got a pain in me gulliver.
I'm livin' in a cuckoo clock! Oh, see you later, kids.
I've got to go rehearse with Ned.
But, Marge, what about dessert? For God's sakes, you can pull the lid off your own can of pudding! Fine.
I will! [ Screeches ] Oh, no.
My pudding is trapped forever! So I can open my own can Of pudding, can I? Shows what you know, Marge.
Marge! Hey, Marge! Keep yelling, you big ape.
Aren't you being a little hard on old Homie? Oh, forget about him.
Let's rehearse the bottle scene.
Oh! Let's not and say we did.
Hmm? - [ Muttering Lines ] - So, what time does this play start? - Why? Are you going? - Well, I gotta go, don't I? I'm sure you won't enjoy it.
There's nothing about bowling in the play.
- Oh, wait, there is.
- Probably not much of it.
Why can't you be a little more supportive? 'Cause I don't care, okay? I can't fake an interest in this and I'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects.
- What "kooky projects"? - You know, the painting class the first aid course, the whole Lamaze thing.
Why didn't you tell me you felt this way? You know I would never do anything to hurt your feelings.
Good night.
[ Snores ] [ Groans ] Playing nicely, little humans? Good, good.
Hello, Maggie.
Poor little "dummard.

Yeah.
How Blanche was sad.
And how that guy Stanley should have been nice to her.
Yeah? Go on.
I mean, it made me feel bad.
The poor thing ends up being hauled to the nuthouse when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect.
Well, at least that's what I thought.
I have a history of missing the point of stuff like this.
No, Homer, you got it just right.
Hey, you know, I'm a lot like that guy.
- Really? - Yeah, like when I pick my teeth with the mail and stuff.
Well, maybe just a little.
- [ People Chattering ] - Shh! 

Let go! Let go! I'm all naked and wet! - Get up, Homer.
It's time for church.
- I don't wanna go.
- It's church.
You have to go.
- Too cold out.
I'm tired of having this argument every Sunday.
Get dressed.
Oh, stupid, itchy church pants.
[ Grunting ] One size fits all, my butt! - Come on.
We're going to be late.
- [Pants Tearing] Forget it.
I'm not going.
[ Growls ] - Hey, where's Homer? - Your father's resting.
"Resting" hungover, "resting" got fired? Help me out here.
Ahhh, I'm just a big, toasty cinnamon bun.
I never wanna leave this bed.
Uh-oh.
Gotta take a whiz.
Think, man.
Think.
Think, think, think.
I better get up.
I'm whizzin' with the door open, and I love it.
[ Singing ] [ Blubbering ] [Man] It's 1 1 K-BBL degrees below zero.
- I hope you're someplace warm.
- You bet your sweet ass! I'm afraid our furnace isn't working.
[Man] Yeah, what's the story? But let's just put it out of our minds and turn to the lamentations of Jeremiah long version.
"Joy is gone from our hearts our dancing has turned to mourning.
'" [Rock And Roll] [Girls Singing] [ Singing ] The perfect chance to make my patented, space-age out-of-this-world moon waffles.
Let's see here.
Caramels.
Waffle batter.
Liquid smoke.
Oooh, waffle runoff.
Mmm, fattening.
And he was cast into the fiery cauldron of hell! The searing heat the scalding rivers of molten sulfur! Ahhh, I'm there.
Uh-oh.
[ Whistling ] Here, boy.
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
The service has ended.
Go in peace.
[Pipe Organ] [ Grunting ] The door's frozen shut, and it's the only way out! - [ Chattering ] - Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be-- Lisa, this is neither the time nor the place.
[Man On Radio] That was Johnny Calhoun with "Gonna Find Mea Genie With a Magic Bikini.
'" [Man #2]Johnny's next record was a spoken word album of his right-wing political views.
It killed his career.
If you can tell me the name Of that album, call our contest line now.
[ Gasps ] I know that! [ Line Ringing ] - Hello.
This is Homer Simpson.
- [ Man ] Homer, can you name that title? - "This Things I Believe.
" - [ Man #2 ] Uh, can we accept that? - [ Cash Register Ringing ] - Whoo-hoo! - How's that door coming, Willy? - Miracles are your department, Reverend.
Uh, while we're waiting, Why don't I read from the Sunday bulletin? Card table for sale.
Top badly damaged.
Leg missing.
Otherwise fine.
One dollar or best offer.
[ Woman On TV] You must be the three chiropractors I sent for.
Now, start manipulating my spine.
[Curly]Hey, Moe, we don't know nothin' about manipulatin.
- [Moe] You heard the lady.
Grab her spine and get crackin.
- [Punch Landing] - [ Chuckling ] Moe is their leader.
- [Curly Whooping] -[Moe] Why, you! -[Punch Landing] -[Curly]Hey! [ Grunting ] Huzzah! Plea-Please, Christians, don't push.
Excuse me.
Pardon me.
Whoop.
Coming through.
Howya doing? Love that hat, baby.
Come on, TV.
Give me some of that sweet, sweet pap.
Well, let's define our terms, gentlemen.
Are we talking about redistricting or are we talking about reapportionment? Oh, well, can't win 'em all.
[ Man ] We interrupt this public affairs program to bring you a football game.
- Yes! - [ Whistle Blowing ] - [ Engine Not Turning Over] - [Marge Imitating Engine] [ Imitating Engine ] - Give it a little more gas.
- [Pedal Banging] No, no, that's too much.
You know what I think would help? - What? What would help? - Nothing.
Oh, doctor.
A 98-yard triple reverse ties the score at 63-63.
We have seen nothing but razzle-dazzle here today three visits from Morganna the Kissing Bandit and the astonishing return of Jim Brown.
Whoo-hoo! Is that what I think it is? Mm-hmm.
I found a penny! Could this be the best day of my life? [ Laughing ] Looks like we have a new champion.
Ah, my beloved family.
- How was church? - [ Muttering ] [ Snorting ] I, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life and I owe it all to skipping church.
That's a terrible thing to say! Kids, your father doesn't really mean that.
Like fun I don't.
Marge, I'm never going to church again! Homer, are you actually giving up your faith? No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Well, yes.
I can't believe you're giving up church, Homer.
Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? - I mean, isn't God everywhere? - Amen, brother.
And don't you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week? - Tell it, Daddy.
- And what if we pick the wrong religion? Every week we're just making God madder and madder.
Testify! [ Groaning ] Lord, my husband is by no means perfect but he's a kind, decent man.
Please show him the error of his ways.
Marge, come to bed.
No, Homer.
He doesn't mean to be sacrilegious, Lord.
He just likes to sleep in on Sundays.
Marge.
Come to bed, Marge.
[ Whispering ] Lord, please.
He's not a bad person, Lord, really.
- It's good for what ails ya.
- He doesn't mean any harm.
I can wait all-- [ Snoring ] [Rumbling] [ Gasps ] [ Static Humming ] [ Gulps ] God? Thou has forsaken my church! - Well, kind of, but-- - But what? I'm not a bad guy.
I work hard and I love my kids.
So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell? Hmm, you've got a point there.
You know, sometimes even I'd rather be watching football.
Does St.
Louis still have a team? - No, they moved to Phoenix.
- Oh, yeah.
You know what I really hate about church? Those boring sermons.
Oh, I couldn't agree more.
That Reverend Lovejoy really displeases me.
I think I'll give him a canker sore.
- Give him one for me.
- I will.
- So I figure I should just try to live right-- - [ Purring ] and worship you in my own way.
Homer, it's a deal.
Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to appear on a tortilla in Mexico.
- Dad, can I ask you a question? - Sure, honey.
Why are you dedicating your life to blasphemy? Don't worry, sweetheart.
If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed.
Hello, my animal friends.
Peace be with you.
Guys, please, could you give me five minutes? Reverend Lovejoy, I had a bit Of an ulterior motive in inviting you to dinner.
- [ Shouts ] What? - No, it's nothing bad.
I'm just concerned because my husband hasn't been attending your services lately.
Well, I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing but then God himself told me I should seek a new path.
- Oh, really? - Yeah.
He appeared before me in a dream and I knew that was special because I usually dream about naked Marge.
- [ Groans ] - So, Homer, you saw the big cheese? - What'd he look like? - Perfect teeth, nice smell, a class act all the way.
Homer, you're crazy! Tell him this is all crazy.
Homer, I'd like you to remember Matthew 7:26.
The foolish man who built his house on sand.
And you remember Matthew 21 :1 7.
"And he left them and went out of the city into Bethany and he lodged there"? Yeah.
Think about it.
Hello, work? This is Homer Simpson.
I won't be coming in tomorrow.
Religious holiday.
The, uh, Feast of Maximum Occupancy.
- Pretty slick.
- You should join my religion, Moe.
It's great.
No hell, no kneeling-- Sorry, Homer.
I was born a snake handler, and I'll die a snake handler.
[Doorbell Rings] Neighbor, I heard about your heresy and we've made it our mission to win you back to the flock.
- No sale.
- Homer, Christian life isn't all praying and sacrifice.
Hey, dig this.
[ Singing Religious Song ] - [ Snoring ] - [Phone Ringing] [ Flanders Family Singing ] [ Singing ] - Leave me alone.
- Dad, the heathen's getting away.
I see him, son.
[ Crossing Bells Dinging ] [ Horn Blaring ] [ Screams ] [ Chuckles ] - Where we going? - Garbage Island.
[ Horn Blaring ] Huh? [ Screaming ] [ Cheering ] Let's go, kids.
How come we have to go to church and Dad gets to stay home and watch cartoons? [ Groans ] I have a responsibility to raise these children right.
And unless you change, I'll have to tell them their father is well, wicked.
Kids, let me tell you about another so-called "wicked" guy.
He had long hair and some wild ideas and he didn't always do what other people thought was right.
And that man's name was-- I forget.
But the point is-- I forget that too.
Marge, you know who I'm talking about.
- He used to drive that blue car.
- Kids, could you wait outside for us? Homer, please don't make me choose between my man and my god because you just can't win.
There you go again.
Always taking someone else's side-- Flanders, the water department, God.
I'm only going to ask you one last time.
Are you sure you won't come with us to church? [ Man On TV] Coming up next: make your own ladder.
Very sure.
My friends, the devil walks among us! [ Chattering ] - I got him! - No, don't look for the pitchfork and pointy tail.
Today's devil has assumed a more seductive form pleasing to the eye.
Oooh, a interview with Lorne Michaels.
Oooh.
Wait.
That's no good.
Hey, now we're talking.
"Our unabashed dictionary defines I.
U.
D.
as "love springs internal.
"' - I don't get it.
- [Doorbell Chimes] Hello.
I'm collecting for the Brotherhood of Jewish Clowns.
Last year, tornadoes claimed the lives of75Jewish clowns.
The worst incident was during our convention in Lubbock, Texas.
There were floppy shoes and rainbow wigs everywhere.
It was terrible.
[ Sobbing ] Wait a minute.
Is this a religious thing? A religious clown thing, yes.
- Sorry.
- Well, bless you any-- Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy! Apu, I see you're not in church.
Oh, but I am.
I have a shrine to Ganesha the god of worldly wisdom located in the employee lounge.
- Hey, Ganesha, want a peanut? - Please do not offer my god a peanut.
No offense, Apu, but when they were handing out religions you must've been out taking a whiz.
Mr.
Simpson, please pay for your purchases and get out and come again.
Pride goeth before destruction! Boy, everyone is stupid except me.
[Snoring] Marge, turn down the heat.
That's better.
[ Snoring ] [ Sniffing, Whines ] [ Growling ] [ Screams ] Fire! What do I do? What do I do? [ Coughing ] Oh, the song, the song.
[ Singing ] D'oh! [ Coughing ] [Apu Gasps] Fire at the old Simpson place! - You're on your honor not to steal anything.
- Oh, we won't.
Little Jamshed, the store is in your hands.
- How I have waited for this day.
- [ Cocks Shotgun ] [ Siren Wailing ] [ Quacking ] You ducks are really trying my patience! But you're so cute.
Homer.
Homer! No! [ Homer Moans ] Dear Lord, may your loving hand guide Homer to the mattress, square and true.
Okay.
[Siren Wailing] [ Coughing ] Flanders, you saved me.
Why? Heck, you'd have done the same for me.
Help! Help! [ Laughing ] That's right, old friend.
- [ Bart, Lisa ] Dad! - Oh, Homie, are you all right? Our magazines and roach traps, gone.
All gone.
[ Cat Screeching ] I saved your cat.
Ow! That hurt.
Hey, what are these axes for? - I don't know.
Chopping stuff.
- Gotcha.
Uh, that's some nice chopping.
Truly, this was an act of God.
Hey, wait a minute.
Flanders is a regular Charlie Church and God didn't save his house.
- D'oh! - Any valuables in the house? Well, the Picasso, my collection of classic cars-- Sorry.
This policy only covers actual losses, not made-up stuff.
Well, that's just great.
Fire, man's oldest foe.
Insatiable, remorseless, unquenchable.
- Hey, it's out.
- [ Cheering ] Coming up next, which work better-- springy clothespins or the other kind? You know, I have a feeling there's a lesson here.
- Yes, the lesson is-- - No, don't tell me.
I'll get it.
Oh, I know.
The Lord is vengeful.
O Spiteful One, show me who to smite, and they shall be "smoten.
" Homer, God didn't Set your house on fire.
No, but he was working in the hearts Of your friends and neighbors when they went to your aid be they Christian, Jew or miscellaneous.
Hindu.
There are - Aw, that's super.
- I was rude to every one of you.
And you saved my life when you could have just left me to fry like the proverbial pancake that I am.
Oh, Homey, I'm so glad to hear you say that.
Now, would you give church another try? I'll be there next Sunday, front row, center.
[ Snoring Loudly] [Harp] Don't feel bad, Homer.
Nine out often religions fail in their first year.
That's game, Hendrix! God, I gotta ask you something.
What's the meaning of life? Homer, I can't tell you that.
- Come on.
- You'll find out when you die.
- I can't wait that long.
- You can't wait six months? No, tell me now.
Well, okay.
Well, okay.

Principal Skinner, "The Happiest Place on Earth' is a registered Disneyland copyright.
Well, gentlemen, it's just a small school carnival.
And it's heading for a great big lawsuit.
You made a big mistake, Skinner.
Well, so did you.
You got an ex-Green Beret mad.
- [ Groaning, Gagging ] - [ Gasps ] [ Groans ] Copyright expired.
And begin! This sucks.
- Aah! - Ha-ha! Pick the red, get ahead.
Pick the black, set you back.
Hmm.
I don't recall authorizing this booth.
Good-bye, gentlemen.
- [ All Gasp ] - [ Coughing ] Get your haggis right here! Chopped heart and lungs boiled in a wee sheep's stomach! Tastes as good as it sounds! Good for what ails ya! [ Mutters, Groans ] I'd say 53 years old and 420 pounds.
- Ha-ha, you lose! 36 and 239.
- Hmm.
[Rock Over P.
A.
] Hey, Otto-man, I dare you to make this go faster.
Ooh! Challenge accepted! [Continues] - I'll be in Mexico till this thing blows over.
- [Spectators Gasping] [ Yelling, Shouting ] Oh, boy! A "spookhouse"! Hand over all your money.
- [Milhouse Grunts] - Was it scary? - Uh-huh.
- Ooh, baby.
Uh-oh.
- So, girlie, you like roller-skating? - No.
Yeah, everybody loves roller-skating.
Okay, you can turn around now.
- [ Gasps ] - [Spectators Laughing] Oh, my God! I'm ugly! Now, in a moment, we'll be raffling of four grand prize-- a ride on the famous Duff Beer blimp! A ride on the Duff blimp.
You see the circular pattern on those fields? - That's from central-pivot irrigation.
- Wow.
Now let's see what's happening at the Super Bowl.
[ Crowd Cheering ] [ Crowd Chanting ] Homer! Homer! Homer! Homer! - [ Chanting Stops ] - [Man]Oops.
Sorry.
[ Chanting Continues ] Homer! Homer! Homer! [ Softly] Homer! Homer! Homer! But first, our second-prize winner and the recipient of this handsome shoe buffer-- Ned Flanders! [ Gasps ] Ah! - [Man]Go, Ned! - Oh, it's no fair.
- We'll never have a buffer.
- We have one at home.
- You never use it.
- Well, I want that one.
And the winner of the blimp ride is Homer Simpson! Oh, my God! [ Whimpers ] [ Singing ] [ Sobbing ] Honey, what's wrong? Dad, do you think I'm ugly? What are you talking about? [ Chuckling ] Oh, Lisa, this isn't real.
It's just how you might look If you were a cartoon character.
- I'm an ugmo.
- Now, that's not true.
You're cute as a bug's ear.
Fathers have to say that stuff.
Dad, am I cute as a bug's ear? - No! You're homely as a mule's butt! - There.
See? I'd like to be alone, please.
[ Sobbing ] Moe, have you ever felt unattractive? - Mmm, no.
- How about you, Barney? Not for a second.
[ Belches ] Yeah.
I need help.
[Together] Whee! Whee! Whee! Whee! Whee! I guess every father thinks his daughter is the cutest.
Well, now there's a way to prove it.
Wow, President of Laramie Cigarettes, jack Larson! This year, Laramie is sponsoring the Little Miss Springfield Pageant.
You see, government regulations prohibit us from advertising on TV.
[ Inhales, Exhales ] Ahh.
That sweet Carolina smoke.
But they can't prohibit us from holding a beauty pageant for little girls age seven to nine.
Lisa's age seven to nine! Your daughter could be crowned Little Miss Springfield by our host the maitre d' of glee, Krusty the Clown! I heartily endorse this event or product.
What a feeling! I'm as happy as a smoker taking that first puff in the morning.
- That could be Lisa! - The Little Miss Springfield Pageant.
Only $250 to enter.
Oh! Hey, Barney, will you give me Sure! [ Gasps ] Where'd you get all the money? From some scientist.
Since they stopped testing on animals a guy like me can really clean up.
[ Gulping ] I'm hideous.
Lisa, I know a song that will cheer you up.
[ Singing ] - So you think I'm ugly? - No! No, I meant you were one Of the good-looking ducks that makes fun of the ugly one.
Lisa, if you could have one wish, what would it be? To shut myself off from the world and never be seen by human eyes again.
Was your second wish to be entered in the Little Miss Springfield Pageant? - What are you talking about? - I sent in an application for you.
I couldn't find a big enough photo, so I sent in that funny drawing of you on roller skates.
How could you? I won't do it! [ Sobbing ] Homer, Lisa's already sensitive about her looks.
- This is the last thing she needs.
- But I think she'll win.
Dad, have you seen the girls they have in those contests? Hubba, hubba! [ Panting ] [ Howling ] Hey, nobody's prettier than my little girl.
You're looking at her through a father's eyes.
Well, if I could gouge out somebody else's eyes and shove them into my sockets, I would.
- But to me, she's beautiful.
- That is so sweet.
Honey, no one's going to force you to do anything.
But do you know how your father got the money to enter you in this pageant? - Nope.
- He sold his ride on the Duff blimp.
But that ride meant everything to him! [ Singing Sadly] I'll do it.
- Did you see Tina Epstein? - Whoa! If you're gonna binge, you'd better purge.
Uh-oh.
- Amber Dempsey.
- In the same week she was Pork Princess and Little Miss Kosher.
- She's beautiful.
- Wait.
She's about to bring out the big guns.
- Eyelash implants.
- I thought those were illegal.
Not in Paraguay.
There's no way I can beat this girl.
She's the Jack Nicklaus Of the pageant circuit.
Oh, I don't know that she's as attractive as Jack Nicklaus.
[ Humming ] I meant because they both win all the time, Mom.
Oh.
Well, yes.
That's what I meant too.
Well, tell you what.
This afternoon I'll take you to the beauty parlor and show you just how lovely you can be.
And later, I'll teach you the tricks of the trade-- taping your swimsuit to your butt petroleum jelly on your teeth for that frictionless smile and the ancient art of padding.
[ Purring ] - Are we done? - We are just warming up.
Oh, isn't this dangerous? Don't worry.
I am well protected.
Boy, when Lisa comes in, I want you to make a big fuss over how she looks.
She'll see through me like Grandma's underpants.
No, she won't.
When it comes to compliments women are ravenous, bloodsucking monsters always wanting more, more, more! And if you give it to 'em, you'll get plenty back in return.
- Like what? - I'll tell you when you're older.
- [ Chuckling ] - [Door Slams Shut] [ Gasps ] Is that Lisa? Ooh, I gotta call heaven.
There's an angel missing.
And who's your little school friend? Wait a minute.
That's Mom! - Oh, my goodness! How gallant! - Isn't that nice? Thank you.
I know two fellas who are gonna get a special dinner tonight.
- Hey, hey! - Whoo-hoo! - Dad, you know anything else about women? - Nope, that's it.
Hey, brush-head, you've been nursing that thing for an hour.
You know, I was just wondering how someone who works at an ice cream store keeps such a trim figure.
I've misjudged you.
[ Piano ] [ Piano ] I said step, pause, turn, pause, pivot, step, step not step, pause, turn, pause, pivot, step, pause! Ooh! Shudder! And the winner is Lisa Simpson! - [ Gasps ] - Okay, wipe away a tear.
Hug the loser.
And now, for your triumphant walk down the runway.
Whoa! Ooh! Aah! It's hopeless! There's nothin' to it.
Give me those heels.
Heel, toe, heel, toe, heel, toe.
Hmm.
Do you really think I can win? Hey, I'm starting to think I can win.
But those other girls are prettier than me.
Lise, as your brother this is the hardest thing I've every had to say.
- You're not ugly.
- Oh, Bart! [Up-tempo] [ Talking Over Music ] Out on our own! Making it work! Gasping for air! Having it all! My name is Amber Dempsey, and when I grow up I want to be a sweetie pie.
[Applause] I am Pahasatira Nahasapeemapetilon and tonight I will be playing "Mac Arthur Park" on the tabla.
[ Laughing ] No, I am serious.
Yes! Judges, there's your queen.
- Who's watching the Kwik-E-Mart? - [ Both Gasp ] - [ Grunting ] - [ Laughing ] My name is Lisa Simpson, and I want to be Little Miss Springfield so I can make our town a better place! Yeah! Clean up this stink-hole! [ Panting, Grunts ] Krusty! About time you got here.
Yeah, yeah.
What is this-- the, uh, Republican fund-raiser? Checking it out! Hitting the heights! Making a wish! Dreaming a dream! [ Singing ] - [ All ] Me! - ####[Ends] Oh, that brisket's not sittin' right.
[ Singing ] [ Snoring ] Oh, that just kept goin', huh? And now here's Lisa Simpson! They'll love you just as much as I do.
Thanks, Dad.
Mmm.
Some people say that to love your country is old-fashioned uncool, real melvin.
Well, to them I say-- [ Singing Patriotic Song ] One, two, three, four! ## [ Singing Rock And Roll Song] [ Cheering ] This is my favorite part Of the pageant, because-- What does that say? Oh.
It gives me a chance to visit with the girls personality.
Uh, personally.
Amber, do you think the Bill of Rights is a good thing or a bad thing? - Um-- - Take your time, dear.
Good thing.
[ All Fawning ] And now it's time to name our runner-up who, if the winner doesn't fulfill her duties-- [ Muttering Incoherently] And don't say it'll never happen because we all remember that thing with what's-her-name.
Click, click.
You know.
Okay, the runner-up is [ Groans ] - [Cymbal Crash] - Lisa Simpson! Which means Amber Dempsey is the new Little Miss Springfield! [Applause] [Orchestra] [ Singing ] Coming up next, a new fad that's sweeping the nation-- wasting food.
But first, let's join the new Little Miss Springfield, Amber Dempsey as she helps open the Danish super-chain "Shop.
" Scott, everyone is here from the mayor's illegitimate son to our own Duff blimp.
- Hi.
Can I drive? - Well, I can't see the harm.
[Barney Yelling] Oh, the humanity! Anyway to turn on the store's "severe tire damage" spikes, here's Little Miss Springfield.
[Fanfare] Oh, dear.
It would be a shame If that pretty dress got wet.
I'd say the greater danger is her scepter acting as a lightning rod.
Unless it's made out of plastic.
- [ Thunderclap ] - Nope.
Metal.
Ladies and gentlemen, Little Miss Springfield has been struck by lightning.
[Man] Doctor, what is Amber's condition? Oh, she'll be fine.
In fact she's already won the Little Miss Intensive Care Pageant.
Congratulations, Lisa.
You're the new Little Miss Springfield.
Here's your scepter.
Oop! [ Laughing ] just kidding.
Here you go.
Oop! [ Laughing ] just kidding.
[ Yelling ] I deserved that.
That doesn't look like her body.
The torso used to be Dr.
Ruth.
Her head is on a pike in the Chamber of Horrors.
[Wolf Howling] - [Wolf Whistles] - Hi, fellas.
Love that "chewing gum" walk.
Very Wrigley.
As Little Miss Springfield, it's my pleasure to welcome you to America the land of opportunity.
Actually, they're being deported.
[ Minor Key] [Man Over P.
A.
]And now, let's give a big Fort Springfield welcome to Mr.
Bob Hope! - What's the mayor's name? - Quimby.
Beautiful.
[Orchestra] Hello, this is Bob "What the hell am I doing in Springfield" Hope.
- ####[Ends] - Hey, how about that Mayor Quimby? He's some golfer! His golfball spends more time underwater than Greg Louganis.
[ Howling Laughter] And now, I wanna show you what you're fighting for, if there was a war on.
Little Miss Springfield.
- Isn't she beautiful? - Little Miss Springfield? First, Tony Randall cancels.
Now this.
- [ Yelling, Shouting ] - Hey, what gives here? This is bogus! Hey! Where do you think you're goin'? We want Miss Springfield! Hey, set me down at that boat show.
I'm gonna be riding on a pack of cigarettes? Mm-hmm.
We think you're the perfect spokesmodel for Laramies.
It's part of our new campaign.
Mmm, classy.
[ Gasps ] You see, Lisa, it's been an unlucky year for Laramie.
A lot of the people who smoke our product have been well, dying.
And we need young smokers to take their place.
I don't wanna be a spokesperson for a cigarette company! But you're a role model To young people.
And we're thinking of retiring Menthol Moose.
[ Coughs, Spits ] Bless you, boys.
- Homer, those are ice cream men.
- I know.
[ Gasps ] - Stop this float! - [ Tires Screech ] - What's the holdup? Go! - I'm tired of being a corporate shill.
[ Grunts ] From now on, I will speak out against the evils in society from dog-napping to cigarettes.
[Lisa] Before I sing the national anthem I'd like to say that college football diverts funds badly needed for education and the arts.
- Is that true? - Let's get 'em! [ Grunting ] Let's get out of here! [ Grunting Continues ] Gentlemen, we need to get Lisa Simpson out and Amber Dempsey back in.
But this glorified, crossing-guard-of-a-police Chief won't get off his big fat can.
Is it okay if I open these potato chips? - [ Groans ] - Gentlemen, our prayers have been answered.
Take a look at our Little Miss Springfield's pageant application.
Roxy, bring in a bottle of champagne.
Yeah, and some dip for these chips or somethin'.
Lisa Simpson is no longer Little Miss Springfield.
She was stripped of her crown in a ceremony earlier today.
Well, that's obviously the wrong footage.
Uh, but it does seem the father of the deposed beauty queen, Homer Simpson filled out the pageant application incorrectly.
In the area under "Do not write in this space," he wrote, "Okay.
" If it wasn't for me, you'd still be queen.
- You must hate me.
- Dad, do you remember why you entered me in that pageant? - I don't know.
Was I drunk? - Possibly.
But the point is, you wanted me to feel better about myself, and I do.
- Really? - Uh-huh.
Will you remember this the next time I wreck your life? It's a deal.
And now, my exclusive interview with His Holiness, Pope John Paul I.
That's it.
I cannot work under these conditions.
If anybody wants me, I'll be downstairs at McDougal's.
Call the weekend guy.
I don't care.

[Somber] Good evening.
I've been asked to tell you that the following show is very scary with stuff that might give your kids nightmares.
You see, there are some crybabies out there-- religious types mostly-- who might be offended.
If you are one of them, I advise you to turn off your set now.
Come on.
I dare ya.
[ Clucking ] Chicken.
- Hey.
- [Footsteps] [Marge]Homer, did you just call everyone "chicken'"? [Homer] No.
I swear on this Bible.
That's not a Bible.
That's a book of carpet samples.
Ooh, fuzzy.
[Thunderclap] [Sinister Laugh] [Woman Screams] [ Maggie Sucking ] [Chattering] Behold mighty Caesar in all his glory! [ All Laughing ] D'oh! I am Calliope, the muse of heroic poetry.
No kiddin'.
[ Groaning ] Stupid party.
Wish we was trick-or-treating.
Now, Bart, you can find just as much horror around the house.
Now, you children may not know it but there was once an evil witch and she died a horrible death.
- These are her eyes.
- [Children]Eww! And this is her hair.
- [Children]Eww! - And these are her brains.
Eww! Yo, Mom.
We haven't got the eyeballs yet.
Homer, you're ruining it.
Yeah, well, it was an evil game.
Well, now we need another Halloween activity.
Hmm.
Does anyone know a ghost story? I do.
It's a story Of a boy and his doll.
- That's not so scary.
- A doll from hell! - I'm gonna go to the store.
- [ Sinister Laugh ] [Grampa] Happy birthday, Bart.
Thanks, Grampa.
- Where'd you get all the money? - The government.
I didn't earn it.
I don't need it.
But if they miss one payment, I'll raise hell! Hey, Homer, where's your present? D'oh! I mean, don't worry, son.
I forgot to get you a present.
But I swear on my father's grave-- - Hey! - I will get you one now.
- [Door Opens] - [Tires Squeal] [Floor Creaking] Do you sell toys? We sell forbidden objects from places men fear to tread.
We also sell frozen yogurt, which I call frogurt.
Well, I need something for my son's birthday.
Uh, perhaps this will please the gentleman.
[Heart Beating] Take this object.
But beware-- it carries a terrible curse.
- Ooh, that's bad.
- But it comes with a free frogurt.
- That's good.
- The frogurt is also cursed.
- That's bad.
- But you get your choice of topping.
- That's good! - The toppings contain potassium benzoate.
- That's bad.
- Can I go now? [ Cheering ] -[Thud, Groan] - Happy birthday, son.
Great Caesar's Ghost! A talking Krusty doll! I'm Krusty the Clown, and I love you very much.
Oh, Dad, this is the best birthday I've ever had.
That doll is evil, I tells ya.
Evil! E-E-Evil! Grampa, you said that about all the presents.
I just want attention.
[ Man On TV] And in environmental news scientists have announced that Springfield's air is now only dangerous to children and the elderly.
Whoo-hoo! I'm Krusty the Clown, and I don't like you.
[ Laughs ] I'm Krusty the Clown, and I'm going to kill you.
[ Chuckles ] Didn't even pull the string that time.
I said I'm going to kill you.
You, Homer Simpson.
Oh, yeah? With what? - Aah! - [ Screams ] Homer, what's wrong? [ Whimpering ] That doll tried to kill me.
I'd say that the pressure's finally gotten to Dad, but what pressure? Don't leave me alone with him.
[ Sinister Laugh ] [ Sinister Laugh Continues ] [ Singing ] - [ Screams ] - [Doll]Scram! [ Screaming ] There goes the last lingering thread Of my heterosexuality.
Hey, baby, get comfortable.
Relax.
It's a little hot for that cheerleader outfit, don't you think? [Foot steps Approaching] [ Grunts ] You think your dirty socks can stop me? Well, they are making me dizzy.
[Groans] - [Wolf Howls] - [Footsteps] Good-bye, dolly.
Arrivederci, Vito.
I was a fool to think anyone would want Nude photos of Whoopi Goldberg.
What the-- - [Tires Skid] - And that is that.
[ Groans, Grunts ] - [Rustling] - Guess who, fat boy! - Marge! Marge, look! - Oh, my God! The doll's trying to kill me, and the toaster's been laughing at me.
[ Gurgling ] Eww! Dog water.
[Touch-tones Beeping] - [ Line Ringing ] - Your doll is trying to kill my husband! Yes, I'll hold.
[ Man Singing On Phone ] [ Homer Groaning ] Yep, here's your problem.
Someone set this thing to "evil.
" - I love you, Homer.
- Come here, you! [Straining] - Here you go, buddy.
- Did you walk the dog? Yeah, he buried me a couple of times.
Yeah, dogs like to bury old junk.
Yeah, you stupid idiot.
Oh, what a day.
Homer made me give him a sponge bath.
[ Shudders ] But coming home to you makes it all worthwhile.
[ Kisses, Chuckles ] Here, let me get that for you.
[Up-tempo] So then his wife comes through the door! - So? - Did I mention she was dead? - No.
- Well, she was.
And she hit him in the head with a golf club.
- And? - Don't you remember? He went golfing all the time, and it really bugged her.
- You said he went bowling.
- D'oh! Homer, I've coughed up scarier stuff than that.
Grampa, why don't you tell us a story? You've led an interesting life.
That's a lie, and you know it! But I have seen a lot of movies.
My name is Marge Bouvier.
I'm here about your ad.
"Single white female wanted for mysterious expedition.
Must like monkeys.
Nonsmoker preferred.
" Well, you'd be a welcome change of pace from the rest of these crude and uncouth sailors.
- Arr!Arr!Arr! - Arr!Arr!Arr! - What do you think, Smithers? - I think women and seamen don't mix.
We know what you think.
Young lady, you're hired.
[ Sinister Laugh ] Hey, I heard we're going to Ape Island.
Yeah, to capture a giant ape.
I wish we were going to Candy Apple Island.
Candy Apple Island? What do they got there? Apes, but they're not so big.
[Chanting] Homer! Homer! Homer! Hey, who's this Homer dude? He's either a 50-foot prehistoric ape or a tourist trap concocted by the Ape Island Jaycees.
- Either way, we're going ashore.
- Am I going too? Of course.
We wouldn't think Of going without the bait.
Uh, that is, the bait-thing beauty.
The bathing beauty.
[ Chuckles ] I covered that up pretty well.
- [Chanting Continues]Homer!Homer!Homer! - [Drums Beating] Homer! Homer! Homer! Homer! [Mr.
Burns] Just try to remain inconspicuous.
[ Speaking Native Language ] - What's he saying? - Uh, he's saying, uh we wouldn't dream of sacrificing the blue-haired woman.
Oh, well, isn't that-- Whoa! - Mm-hmm.
- [ Screaming ] [ King Homer Grunting ] - [ Gongs ] - Huh? D'oh! [Echoing] D'oh! D'oh! D'oh! [ Screaming ] [ Screaming ] Smithers, this is a golden opportunity.
If we get him alive, we can put him on Broadway.
Dead, we'll sell monkey stew to the army.
[ Chuckles ] Ooh! Keep your hands To yourself, mister.
[ Sniffs, Trills ] - [ Giggles ] - [Mr.
Burns]Now we don't want to kill him.
Shoot him around The groin and belly.
- [ Roars ] - [ Gunfire ] [ Roaring ] Hey, Homer, cut it out.
Come on, quit eating me.
Ow! Nice shot, Carl.
No! No! [ Gulps, Burps ] All right, you big ape.
Get a snoot full of this gas bomb.
[ Shudders ] [ Singing ] [ Roars, Whimpering ] [ Yawns ] [ Snoring ] Nice work, Smithers.
When we get back, I'm giving you a raise.
- [ Gulps, Snoring ] - Oh, well.
[Broadway] - [Applause] - [ Roars ] What kind of show you got for us, Mr.
Burns? Well, the ape's going to stand around for three hours or so.
Then we'll close with the ethnic comedy Of Dugan and Dershowitz.
Sensational! - [Drumroll] - Ladies and gentlemen in his native land, he was a king.
But he comes before you in chains For your own amusement.
Presenting Homer-- the Eighth Wonder of the World! [ Audience Gasps ] Wow! Look at the size Of that platform! [ Grunting ] I think you're making him angry.
Come on.
What's he gonna do? Run amok in downtown Springfield? - [ Roars ] - [Audience Clamoring] - [ Screams ] - [ Grunting ] [ Screaming ] [ Roars ] Hey, monkey, you want a peanut? I said one! [ Grunting ] [ Singing ] - [Roars] - [ Screaming ] [ Girl Yelling, Indistinct ] [Car Horn Honking] I'm dreading the reviews.
I can tell you that.
Oh, hi, Homie.
[ Screaming ] [ Grunting ] Oh! - He's sure taking his sweet time.
- Better refuel.
[ Grunting ] You know, you look a little flushed.
Maybe you should eat more vegetables and less people.
Uh-huh.
[ Panting ] [ Yells ] [ Groaning ] He's not dead! No, but his career is.
I remember when Al Jolson ran amok at the Winter Garden and climbed the Chrysler Building.
After that, he couldn't get arrested in this town.
[ Moaning ] Don't worry, Homie.
I'll take care of you.
[Organ] Are you with the bride or groom? [ Chittering ] Right this way.
[ Scratching ] Folks, if you could just stop cleaning each other for a second.
Wait.
Wait, Marge.
I can't find your father.
[ Crunching, Slurps, Burps ] Oh, Homer.
[Up-tempo] Now, kids, instead of candy I thought I'd serve an array of healthy fresh fruits.
[ Kids Grumbling ] Fruit is nature's candy.
[Grumbling Continues] - Whoa! - [ Moaning ] [ Screaming ] [ Chuckling ] Hey, hi, fellow Halloweenies.
Did I scaredely-dareya? [ Yelling, Groaning ] Dag-- darn it! Nice try, Mr.
Flanders, but I've got a story so scary -you'll wet your pants.
- Too late.
From "A" apple to "Z" zebra Baby's First Pop-up Book is 26 pages of alphabetic adventure.
Bart, you mean to tell me you read a book intended for preschoolers? - Well, most of it.
- You have to read another book.
"Find Waldo Yet Again.
'" Man, he's just not trying anymore.
Gee, never noticed that before.
[ Footsteps Echoing ] [ Rats Squeaking ] Ow! What's this? - Evil! - Evil! - Madness.
- Beware! - Beware! - Cool! - [Voices In Book]Ow! Ow! Ow! [ Sighs ] "Chapter Eight: Let's Talk Zombies.
"If a zombie bites you, you become a zombie.
You must walk the earth, feeding on the brains Of the living until the spell is broken.
" Bart, please.
Don't you remember that Snowball I died four years ago tonight? Run over by the mayor's beer-swilling brother, Clovis.
Hey, maybe there's a spell in here that'll bring her back from the dead.
Let's see what we've got.
"How To Get Your Skeletons Their Whitest.
Selling Your Soul In A Buyer's Market.
" Ah, here we are.
"How To Raise The Dead.
" [ Sinister Laugh ] [ Clanging ] [ Creaking ] [Wind Whistling] "Cullen.
Rayburn.
Narz.
Trebek.
" "Zabar, Kresge, Caldor, Wal-Mart!" [ Wailing ] It's not working.
[ Sighs ] Bart, you cast the wrong spell.
Zombies! Please, Lise, they prefer to be called "the living impaired.
" [ Scraping ] There! Pretty as a picture.
- [ Growling ] - Ach! Zombies! There! Pretty as a picture.
[ Both Panting ] [ Zombies Wailing ] Well, howdy, strangers.
What can I do ya for? [ Zombies ] Brains.
Brains.
Why, Sue Dokes, you rascal.
I thought you were dead and-- - [Ned Screams] - [ Crunching ] Dad, we did something very bad! - Did you wreck the car? - No.
- Did you raise the dead? - Yes! - But the car's okay? - Uh-huh.
All right, then.
[ Crunching ] Martin Prince, report to my office at once.
And bring that big, juicy, chess club brain of yours along with you.
[ Smacking Lips ] Mmm.
[ Whimpering ] Hey, kids, look what you can win in the Krusty Sweepstakes.
- [ Wailing ] - [ Screams ] [Upbeat] To enter, send me your parents' brains or write "Parents' Brains" on a three-by-five card and send it to-- Homer, did you barricade the door? Why? Oh, the zombies.
No.
- [ Wailing ] - [ Screaming ] Spare my family.
Take me.
Take me.
- [ Wailing ] Hmm? - [ Hollow Tapping ] - Brains! Brains! - Brains! Brains! I thought dabbling in the black arts would be good for a chuckle.
How wrong I was.
I should have never read that book.
Wait, Bart.
Maybe the library has another book that will reverse the spell.
It's our only hope.
To the book depository.
[ Zombies Moaning ] Hey, Simpson.
I'm feeling a mite peckish.
Mind if I chew your ear? - [Body Thuds] - [ All Gasp ] - Dad, you killed the Zombie Flanders.
- He was a zombie? [Man] K-ZMB--All-zombie radio.
[Zombies Moaning] The zombies have the Earthlings on the run.
Soon, the human race will wither and fall like the earth plums we have seen on the observe-a-scope.
[ Sinister Laughs ] Ow! Careful, not the face.
[ Wailing ] - [ Bones Crunching ] - [ Mumbling ] - Barney, not you too! - I'm not a zombie.
But hey-- when in Rome.
- Wow, George Washington! - Take that, Washington! - [Gunshot] - [Body Thuds] - Eat lead, Einstein.
- [Gunshot] - [Einstein] Oy! - Show's over, Shakespeare! Is this the end of Zombie Shakespeare? [ Groans ] - Hurry, Bart! - "Kolchak.

- Oh! - "Trojan.
Ramses.

" [ Wailing ] See ya in hell.
- Still pushin' that boulder? - Uh-huh.
Excuse me.
I'm John Smith.
john Smith, 1 882? My mistake.
The, uh, zombies that plagued our town are now just corpses rotting in our streets.
- [ Townspeople ] Yea! - [ Groans ] Well, I'm sure glad we didn't turn into mindless zombies.
Shh! TV.
- [Thud On TV] - [Audience Laughs] [ Monotone ] Man fall down.
Funny.
[ All Grunt ] [Wolf Howls] [Macabre Organ] 
 [Captain Kirk] Captain's log.
Stardate 6051.
Had trouble sleeping last night.
My hiatal hernia is acting up.
The ship is drafty and damp.
I complain, but nobody listens.
[Man Announcing] Star Trek XI: So Very Tired.
See the original cast in their latest, greatest adventure.
Captain, Klingons Off the starboard bow.
Again with the Klingons! Mr.
Scott, give me full power.
It's no good, Captain.
I cannot reach the control panel.
Movies! What a rip-off!.
I don't have to sit here and take this! I-- [ Snoring ] - Hubba hubba.
Oh, you kid.
- Thank you, dear.
Now, be good for Grampa while we're at the parent teacher meeting.
- We'll bring back dinner.
- What are we gonna have? Well, that depends on what the teachers say.
If you've been good, pizza.
If you've been bad uh, let's see-- poison.
What if one of us has been good and one of us has been bad? - Poisoned pizza.
- Oh, no.
I'm not making two stops.
All right.
I'll talk to Lisa's teacher this year.
- You can have Bart's.
- That's the way we do it every year.
All right.
Tell you what.
I'm thinking Of a number between 1 and 50.
- Is it 37? - D'oh! I mean, no.
- Homer! - Please, Marge? Please, please, please, please, please? - Oh, all right.
- Whoo-hoo! - U.
S.
A! U.
S.
A! U.
S.
A! - [Horn Honking] Agh! - [ Flatulent Noise ] - [ Gasps ] Hee-hee! Bart has been guilty Of the following atrocities-- synthesizing a laxative from peas and carrots replacing my birth control pills with Tic Tacs.
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm sure Bart doesn't really mean to be bad.
- [ Snoring ] - Now's our chance to be bad.
[ Chuckles ] Mr.
Simpson, I just wanted to tell you that you've done a wonderful job with Lisa.
- You must have read to her at a young age.
- I did.
I did read to her.
"8:00.
Happy Days.
"The Fonz, Henry Winkler is worried he's losing his cool.
" Well, I've always been a firm believer in the three "Rs"-- reading TV Guide, um writing to TV Guide and renewing TV Guide.
Now, we don't usually do this, but we have some witnesses.
Come in, Arthur.
Now, where did Bart stick the fireworks? - [ Gasps ] - [ Snoring ] Over the lips and past the gums-- look out dentures, here I come.
- Ew! - [ Growls ] - [ Chuckles ] - [ Growls ] "My child is on the honor roll at Springfield Elementary.
" You know, I never thought I'd find a replacement for my "Where's the Beef?" bumper sticker.
[ Chuckles ] "Where's the Beef?" Uh, we'd like the desk back, Mr.
Simpson.
Huh? [ Chuckles ] Oh.
[ Lively] Yaah! I really don't see how this helps Bart.
-Just do it.
- [ Groans ] - Busted! - Homer, we have a problem here.
Are you kidding? Lisa turned out perfect.
I won't stand here and listen To you bad-mouthing Lisa! - We're talking about Bart! - Oh.
That guy.
I think the problem here is discipline.
- If Bart does something wrong, you should punish him.
- Well, we try.
But he has this way ofmaking us think we've punished him when actually we've completely caved in.
- He's the boy you love to hate.
- Well, you've got to start being firm with him.
I believe, with persistent discipline even the poorest student can end up becoming, oh, say chief justice of the Supreme Court.
Chief justice Of the Supreme Court.
What great men he would join-- john Marshall Charles Evans Hughes, Warren Berger-- Mmm, burger.
- And what if we don't? - Then there's no telling how low he can sink.
[Man] All right, ladies.
Prepare to be blownaway By Bang Bang Bart.
- #### [Dance] - [ Pistols Firing ] [ All Booing ] - You're fat! -Just more of me to love, honey.
- [ Booing Continues ] - [ Groaning ] Oh! My poor baby! [Car Tires Screech] - [Car Doors Shut] - Uh-oh.
What? What's that? - Hi, Mom.
Hi, Dad.
Home already? - [ Muttering ] Boy, time really flies when you're reading-- The Bible? Ew.
- Well, we brought some pizza.
- [ Exclaiming, Indistinct ] If you don't start making more sense, we're gonna have to put you in a home.
You already put me in a home.
Then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on 60Minutes.
I'll be good.
Look what your bad egg Of a son did to my teeth! Dad, you and your stories.
"Bart broke my teeth.
" "The nurses are stealing my money.
" "This thing on my neck is getting bigger.
" Now, this is exactly what Bart's teacher was talking about.
Our son did something wrong, and you look the other way.
But, Marge, look at that hangdog expression.
He's learned his lesson.
- Let's get him a present.
- [ Groans ] - Please, Homer.
Why do I always have to be the bad guy? - All right, all right.
Young man, since you broke Grampa's teeth, he gets to break yours.
Oh, this is gonna be sweet.
- No, no, no! - Ohh.
Bart, we're sending you to bed without your supper.
Yeah, right.
Like you're gonna let me go hungry.
I'll be eating that pizza in five minutes.
- Bart, stop being confident.
- [Grampa] Doggoneit! - Ohh.
- Oh, Grampa.
I'm starving! Somebody bring me some food quick! - I'm a-comin', boy! - [Marge]Homer, get back here! There must be something to eat around here.
- [ Whimpering ] - Hmm.
- [ Panting ] - [ Yelps ] Gee, maybe they mean it this time.
- From now on, I guess I'd better straighten up and fly-- - [Homer]Bart.
Don't tell your mother, but I brought you some pizza.
just promise me you'll try to be good.
- I promise.
- That-a-boy.
[ Chuckling ] Sucker.
- [ Pistol Cocks ] - Well, well.
If it isn't the tooth fairy.
[ Man ] Coming for Christmas, The Itchy and Scratchy Movie.
[ Laughing Maniacally] [ Gasps ] Bart! Stick around, Mr.
Bond.
Things are really starting to cook.
[Chuckling Evilly] [Lisa]Bart, come quick! There's an Itchy and Scratchy movie! [ Gasps ] [ Man ] If you want suspense-- [ Screaming ] romance-- Mmm! you'll find it in The Itchy and Scratchy Movie coming soon to a theater near you.
- Fifty-three percent new footage.
- Wow.
- Bart, did you take out the garbage like I asked? - Indeed I did.
-[Goats Bleating] - D'oh! - Hey, you goats get out of here! - [ Hissing ] Boy, you're gonna have to be punished for this.
Dad, you could punish me.
But that means you have to think of a punishment sit here and make sure I do it-- - Ohh.
- Or you could let me go play with Milhouse while you spend the afternoon watching unpredictable Mexican sitcoms.
Â¡Ay, elestÃ³mago! [ Chuckles ] Run along, you little scamp.
- [ Gasps ] - Huh? [ Chuckling ] [Singing] Bart! Why are you doing that? - I don't know.
- Well, this time you must be punished! Well, you could punish me, but-- No tricks, boy.
I said I'm gonna punish you.
And come hell or high water, I-- - ####[Faint] - Wait a minute! [ Gasps ] Ice cream truck! [ All Clamoring ] Me! Me! I was here first! Mmm.
Now, what were we talking about, boy? Uh, we were talking about the time you beat jury duty.
Oh, yeah.
The trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races.
- We're home! - We got beets! - Bart, are you pulling up the carpet? - Uh-huh.
- Why are you letting him do this? - I don't know.
- Well, punish him.
- All right, all right.
Bart, go toyour room.
See you in the funny pages.
- How could you let this happen? - How could you let this happen? - I wasn't here.
- Oh, how convenient.
Homer, do you want your son to become Chief justice of the Supreme Court or a sleazy male stripper? Can't he be both, like the late Earl Warren? - Earl Warren wasn't a stripper.
- Now who's being naive? - Look, you have to help discipline your son.
- All right, Marge.
I swear to you-- the next time he does something wrong, I'll punish him and make it stick.
[ Kent Brockman ] Tonight on Eye on Springfield we meet a man who's been hiccupping for 45 years.
[ Hiccups ] Kill me.
[ Hiccups ] Kill me.
But first, we'll examine the growing Itchy and Scratchy mania with their new movie premiering today.
I got my ticket.
[ Kent Brockman ] I'm here live in Korea to give you a firsthand look at how American cartoons are made.
But first, let's take a look back at the year 1 928 a year when you might have seen Al Capone dancing the Charleston on top of a flagpole.
[ Fast Jazz ] Yaah! It was also the year Of the very first Scratchy cartoon entitled "That Happy Cat.
" [ Orchestra ] [ Whistling Along ] The film did very poorly.
But the following year, Scratchy was teamed up with a psychotic young mouse named Itchy and cartoon history was made.
Here's their first cartoon together-- "Steamboat Itchy.
" [ Whistling ] - [ Whistle Sounds ] - [ Horn Tooting ] [ Whistling ] [ Screaming ] - [ Screaming ] - [ Chuckling ] Oh, me, oh, my.
- ## [ Fanfare ] - [ Laughing ] During the war, Itchy and Scratchy put their differences aside and teamed up to fight a bigger foe.
[ Patriotic ] We'll be back with a real-life Itchy and Scratchy-- a rabid mouse in Boston who attacked and killed a small cat.
[ Chuckling ] Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie? Sounds like something you'd say.
Hey, where is she? Oh, my Lord! Oh, isn't that cute.
A baby driving a car.
And look.
There's a dog driving a bus.
Hey! [Alarm Sounding] All right! Time for a crime spree.
All right, boy.
This calls for the biggest punishment I ever handed down and this time it's gonna stick.
- Come on, Homer.
This isn't funny.
- Damn right! Bart, you can't go to see that Itchy and Scratchy movie ever! [ Gasps ] [ Groans ] Oh, no! Beta! Dad, you gotta let me see that movie.
Can't you just give me a spanking? Come on.
Go nuts.
Don't point that thing at me.
I said you're not going to the movie, and I'm sticking to it.
Dad, I agree that Bart should be punished but The Itchy and Scratchy Movie is the defining event of our generation.
How would you've liked it if someone told you That you couldn't watch the moon landing? Hmm.
That's one small step for man.
One giant leap for mankind.
[ Sniffles ] [ Singing Pop ] [ Singing Continues ] Sorry, but the punishment stands.
I regret nothing! [ Groans ] - Someday you'll thank me for this, son.
- Not bloody likely.
No, it's true.
You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt, but my dad wouldn't get it for me.
So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table.
The doctor thought I might have brain damage.
- Dad, what's the point of this story? - I like stories.
Can I please go to the movie? I know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but I can't go back on it.
- You're welcome to watch anything you want on TV.
- TV sucks.
I know you're upset right now, so I'll pretend you didn't say that! [ Man On TV] The master craftsman can make three mailboxes an hour.
I'm not licked yet.
I can entertain myself.
No matter how good a movie is, it can't compare to the imagination of a small boy.
[ Groans ] - How was it? - It wasn't that great.
- Be honest.
- It was the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life! And you wouldn't believe the celebrities who did cameos-- Dustin Hoffman, Michael Jackson-- Of course, they didn't use their real names, But you could tell it was them.
- Lisa! - Sorry, Bart.
It's just not the same.
I've seen The Itchy and Scratchy Movie I've seen it 17 times.
You guys must be getting pretty tired of that movie by now.
- No one who saw the movie would say that! - Let's get him! [ Screams ] Homer, we'd like to talk to you.
But then I won't be watching TV.
You can see the bind I'm in.
Dad, you've gotta let Bart see that movie.
I've never seen him like this.
He has the demented melancholia Of a Tennessee Williams heroine.
- Don't you think I know that? - Well, it's been two months.
You laid down the law, and I'm proud of you.
- But I think we've gotten through to him.
- Ah, sweet, softhearted Marge.
You just can't see the big picture.
If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up chief justice of the Supreme Court.
If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a Mr.
Tight Buns competition.
I can't let that happen.
I won't let that happen.
And I can't let that happen.
One for Itchy and Scratchy.
- We promised your dad we wouldn't.
- [ Groans ] I'm here at the Springfield Aztec Theater where, after eight months and nine Academy Awards The Itchy and Scratchy Movie is showing for the last time.
Tomorrow, a new movie starring Liza Minnelli and Mickey Rourke will open.
Will it be as successful? Only time will tell.
Well, Dad, I guess you won.
No, son.
We both won.
You don't know it now, but I've started you on the road to somewhere very special.
Well, I'll be.
The Itchy and Scratchy Movie.
Come on.
What do you say? All right.
I think you've learned your lesson.
One senior citizen and one chief justice Of the Supreme Court.
Eh, eh, eh.
I'll get it, son.

Busy.

- Good.
Assemble the aluminum J-channel using self-furring screws.
- Install.
- What do I do in case-- After applying brushable coating to the panels-- - Wait a minute.

- Ohh! - Now parge the lath.
[Glass Shatters] - Did you see the bubble? - Yeah, I'm afraid the whole west side of your house is sinking.
Uh, I figure it's gonna Cost you, oh, 8,500.
Forget it! You're not the only foundation guy in town! Let's see.
"Foundation Repair".
Ah, here we are-- D'oh! Leaving the vice president in charge.
And now, Leaning Tower of Pisa, Eat your heart out and move over.
This is one story that's not on the level! [ All Laughing ] Behold the horrors Of the slanty shanty.
See the twisted creatures that dwell within.
Meet Cue Ball, the man with no hair! Huh? [ Growls ] - [ All Gasping ] - He's hideous! - We have to do something.
- [Crashing] Marge, it'll cost $8,500.
We only have 500 in the bank, and that leaves eighty-hundred we need.
- I could get a job.
- Hey! Then I could follow my dream-- living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts.
[ Thinking ] March 1 5th.
I wish I brought a TV.
Oh, God, how I miss TV.
[ Chittering ] - I think you have to keep your job too.
- Aw! It was the most beautiful, most expensive train ever built-- the Spruce Caboose.
Some people said it was too big to stay on the tracks.

- Follow the Headless Brakeman.
Power plant retirement party-- Ow!-- - [Crash] - right this way.

Boring! A man who provided the Burns Corporation with 45 years of faithful service - Mr.
Jack Marley.
- Boring! [ Seething ] Mr.
Burns, If you don't mind I've prepared a little musical number For Jack's special night.
[ Singing ] [ All Laughing ] Do you mind If I say a few words? Oh, "Me, me, me.
I need all the attention just because it's my party," eh? [ Scoffs ] Please don't make me retire.
My job is the only thing that keeps me alive.
I never married, and my dog is dead.
- ## [ Up-tempo ] - I'm not finished.
Oh, yes, you are.
Yaah! With the departure of Mr.
Marley there will now be an entry-level position open in Sector 7G.
- Now, get out.
The bar is closed.
- [ All Groaning ] Maybe I should apply for that job.
Forget it, Marge.
We already live together.
We shouldn't work together.
As the Bible says "Thou shalt not horn in on thy husband's racket.
" Where does the Bible say "racket"? It's in there.
Look, Marge, We just don't need the money that bad.
[ Yelling ] Well, Lisa, I finished my rÃ©sumÃ©.
Uh, I think it needs a little padding.
- What are you putting in there? - Up, up, up.
When I'm done.
Chauffeur.
Seamstress.
Curator of large mammals? Marge, have you seen my lunch box? - Oh, I see.
- [ Chuckles ] Mom, they expect you to lie a little.
"Worked for the Carter Administration"? Well, you voted for him twice! Lisa, shh! Someone might be listening.
Mm-hmm.
Uh-huh.
- Oh, I thought Muddy Waters wrote that song.
- [ Groans ] This rÃ©sumÃ© is very impressive.
Let me be the first to say-- [ Speaking Foreign Language ] - What? - Welcome aboard.
I guess my Swahili's not as good as yours.
[ Nervous Chuckle ] Oh, yeah.
Hmm.
Sorry, the position has been filled.
- [ All Muttering ] - Oh, dear.
Marge, you're making a big mistake.
- I'm gonna see you all day at work and all night at home-- - [ Groans ] And that's good! But here's the bad part.
Uh-- Uh-- Ooh! Look at that headline! "Canada To Hold Referendum.
" Sorry, Marge.
Can't talk now.
We need the money, and my life is pretty boring.
Last week some Jehovah's Witnesses came to the door and I wouldn't let them leave.
They snuck away when I went in the kitchen to get more lemonade.
- Yeah, lemonade is good.
- I think it's wonderful.
Mom and Dad side by side at the power plant.
- You'll be just like Marie and Pierre Curie.
- What did they do? They discovered radium.
Then they both died of radiation poisoning.
Hmm! - [ Growling ] - [ Screaming ] It's the Curies! We must flee! [ Shouting, Growling ] Cool.
Now, Marge, just remember-- If something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak English.
Ah, Tibor, how many times Have you saved my butt? [ Chuckles ] Maggie, Your baby sitter's here.
What's that mean? Oh, you must be sick.
Let's see.
What's old Doc Washburn prescribe? Do you have dropsy? The grippe? Scrofula? The vapors? Jungle rot? Dandy fever? Poor man's gout? Housemaid's knee? Climatic poopow? The staggers? Dum-dum fever? And this is your office.
That idiot Tibor lost the key but you canjimmy it open with a credit card.
- [ Whirring ] - Well, have fun.
- What do I do? - [ Chuckles ] Marge, please.
According to your rÃ©sumÃ©, you invented this machine.
[All Yelling] Put away your books, children.
It's time for your English test.
[ Groaning ] Sick, on test day.
Why? Why? Bart, have you ever read "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"'? I'm halfway through it! I swear! [ Groaning ] - [Footsteps Retreating] - [Door Slams] [ Scoffs ] Marge, what are you doing? It's lunchtime.
I'll just be a minute.
I have to finish this paperwork.
Marge, Marge, Marge let's file this under "R" for arrivederci.
- Where does it go? - Don't worry, baby.
The tube'll know what to do.
Good news, boy.
I found a pharmacy that carries leeches! Well, it wasn't exactly a pharmacy.
More of a bait shop.
Look, Grampa, I'm fine! I really don't need any more home remedies.
Oral thermometer, my eye! Think warm thoughts, boy, 'cause this is mighty cold.
[Bart Screaming] [Mr.
Burns] Jackanapes.
Lollygaggers.
Noodle heads! Enchantress! That woman-- She's so captivating.
Smithers, my heart's pounding like a jackhammer.
I must have her.
Smithers, zoom in.
Closer.
Closer.
Closer, damnit! - Ow! - Too close.
[ Humming ] - Hello! - Mr.
Burns! Oh, no need for alarm.
I just came to give you the orchids and fragrant bath oils I lavish upon all my employees.
- Oh, aren't you nice.
- [ Chuckles ] Gee, this makes me wonder why morale here is so low.
[ Sobbing ] I am the angel of death.
The time of purification is at hand.
Oh, who cares.
Marge, what can we do? Well, you could give them healthier snacks, theme days-- You mean like Child Labor Day? Mmm.
Actually, I was thinking of Funny Hat Day.
- Oh.
- Ooh! And how about piping in some Tom Jones music? That always cheers me up.
[Man Singing Pop] It's working! It's working! And the healthy snacks are on their way.
You can't take our doughnuts! Yaah! Right.
Anyone else want to be a hero? Ooh.
Marge, I'm giving you a raise and a new office right next to mine.
[ Chuckling ] But, sir, that's my office.
Don't worry, Smithers.
I'm putting you where the action is.
Springtime fresh, Winter white.
- What could be better? - Oh, man, I really gotta-- No-o-o! So, Bart, how are you feeling? - Can't complain.
- Well, then, you're ready for your makeup test.
[ Groaning ] My ovaries! [ Chuckles ] Suckers.
Have you ever read "The Boy Who Cried Wolf"'? I glanced at it.
Boy cries "wolf," has a few laughs.
I forget how it ends.
[ Sputtering ] Bart, is that light green? - Yeah.
- It better be! - Hey! - [ Groans ] - Homie, what's wrong? - I'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me-- friends, coworkers, Tibor.
I never thought it'd be my own wife.
Well, maybe you'd get promoted If you worked a little harder.
Are you kidding? I work like a Japanese beaver.
Oh, really? I came to See you three times today.
Twice you were sleeping and once you were kicking that ball of electrical tape around.
Well, I won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks I'm lazy.
I'm gonna go right downstairs, unfold the couch, unroll the sleeping ba-- Eh, good night.
[ Snoring ] [Sighs]I dreamed about her again last night, Smithers.
You know that dream where you're in bed, and they fly in through the window? [ Moaning ] You've been reading My wish book, sir.
Yes, well, Smithers, I want you to arrange a party for two at my estate-- Marge, me, and do you think you could dig up Al Jolson? Uh, do you remember we did that once before? Oh, that's right.
He's dead.
And rather pungent.
The rest of that night is something I'd like to forget.
All right, then.
Bring me that crooner she likes so much, Tom Jones.
These spurs are killing me.
Ey-y-y.
Sit on it.
Lenny, '50s day is next Wednesday.
I gotta go home and change! [Motorcycle Revving] - Here's your money.
- You know the problem here was water leakage.
If you just buy a fifty-cent washer-- I've got a better idea.
Get the hell out! Look, I've got some washers in my truck.
I'll give you one.
Marge, get my gun.
[Fanfare] [Women Screaming] - Tom Jones? - Yes? I was wondering if you'd be interested in performing at a private party.
Sorry, mate.
I don't do private parties.
Well, then, perhaps you should look in this suitcase.
All right, but I don't see-- [ Gagging, Coughing ] Pleasant dreams, Mr.
Jones.
Bart, to avoid this test, you've had smallpox, the bends and that unfortunate bout of rabies.
Well, I'm not sure I'm over it.
[ Clicking ] Shove it, witch.
[ Barking ] No more excuses! [ Muttering ] Tourette's syndrome.
[ Barking ] Her claws are really digging into my skull.
She can crush clams with them.
- Get it off, get it off, get it off!.
- [ Squawks ] Here we have an Alaskan timberwolf.
He weighs240pounds, and his jaws Can bite through a parkingmeter.
- He does get spooked by loud noises.
- "Loud"? That's our secret word for the day! [Alarms Sounding] [ All Cheering ] [ Growling ] [ All Screaming ] - Oh, my God! - Baah! - She must think you're after her eggs.
- I only ate one! - [ Growling ] - Nice doggie.
"Ivanhoe is the story of a Russian farmer and his tool.
" [ Growling ] Wolf!.
Wolf!.
Wolf!.
- I'm afraid you'll have to do better than that.
- [Growling] - Ow! - Sorry.
No sale.
You're wasting valuable test time.
Mr.
Burns, you wanted to see me? Uh, actually, I was wondering If you were free for a little get-together tonight.
Dinner, dancing, and Mr.
Tom Jones.
- Hello, Marge.
- That's it.
Big smile.
Everybody's happy.
- Oh, my goodness! - [ Groans ] My husband will be so excited! You have a husband? Yes.
I can picture him now-- rugged good looks, sweater knotted about his shoulders curly locks shining in the sun like spun gold! Homer, Mr.
Burns gave me another raise today.
[ Laughing ] The senile old fool.
- You're fired! - You can't fire me just because I'm married.
I'm going to sue the pants off you.
You don't have to sue me to get my pants off.
[ Purrs ] - [ Groans ] - [ Growling ] [ Screaming ] [Willie] Hey, wolfie, putdown that hors d'oeuvre.
It's time for the main course! [ Yelling ] Back to class, lad.
Nothin' to see here.
[ Shouting ] Here's my test.
I'm not even going to grade this until you tell me the truth about what happened out there.
The truth is-- There was no wolf.
I faked the whole thing.
I'm just gonna lie on the floor now.
- Please don't let me swallow my tongue.
- [Body Thuds] There.
Doesn't it feel better to tell the truth? Oh, dear.
All right, now, boy.
We've got to rub some garlic on you before the next full moon.
- [ Panting ] - Don't feel bad for losin'.
I was wrestling wolves back when you were at your mother's teat.
Why, Marge, look at all those flies buzzing around your head.
You're a mess, woman.
[ Maniacal Laughing ] So, do you think I have a case? Mrs.
Simpson, you're in luck.
Your sexual harassment suit is just the thing I need to rebuild my shattered practice.
Care to join me in a belt of scotch? It's 9:30 in the morning.
Yeah, but I haven't slept in days.
Last chance.
Oh, yeah.
Mr.
Burns, we've got witnesses, precedent and a paper trail a mile long.
Yes, well, I have [ Gasping, Yells ] He left his briefcase.
Hey! It's full of shredded newspapers.
Well, I guess that's it.
People like us can't afford justice.
- Come on, Homie.
Let's go before he fires you too.
- No! Mr.
Burns, I'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife.
- You love her too.
- Damn right! Homer, I want you to show this woman the time of her life.
Gotcha.
Marge, we're gettin' some drive-through; then we're doing it twice.
No, no, no.
I've got something even more special in mind.
[ Singing ] - Mwah! - Ooh! Get help, luv.
Call Interpol, get me a hacksaw, anything.

Okay, Ron, which one of our girls said the following about you-- "He looked so sexy, I hoped we would have sex"? Well, that's a tough one, 'cause I did the deed with Uta, Candy and Shasta.
- [ All Giggling ] - It's true, all right! [ Chuckles ] But I'm gonna have to go with Shasta 'cause she liked makin' bacon on the beach.
Ooh.
Me too.
- Ahhh, bacon.
- [Knocking On Door] Mr.
Simpson, my husband and I have decided to move.
Gonna run out the clock in Florida, eh? Yes.
Well, there's a few things you could do to help us sell our home.
First, whenever you walk in front of your window - could you please wear pants? - Mmm, no.
Second, could you please take in your jack-o'-lanterns - from past Halloweens? - [ Buzzing ] - Mmm, no.
- And please cover your garbage.
It's attracting wildlife.
Wha-- Hey, moose! Shoo! Yeah, I'm talkin' to you! Get off my lawn, now! [ Yells ] Hello.
What's this? Wire hangers.
Expired medicine.
Old newspapers! [ Panting ] Okay, Homer, stay calm.
just quietly get this stuff inside your house.
Homer, you're not listening! - That medicine's not for you.
- Come on, Marge.
Maybe I'm not getting enough estrogen.
- Give me that.
- [Man On TV]Ahoy, mateys.
Had your fill of tacos? Would ye sooner eat a bilge rat than another burger? Then come for all-you-can-eat seafood at The Frying Dutchman.
[ Drooling Loudly] - Is it more iced tea ye be needing? - Okay.
[ Laughing Heartily] Set sail for The Frying Dutchman.
Aye, aye, Captain.
Marge, we're going to that restaurant.
But I think I'm allergic to seafood.
The last time I ate shrimp, my throat closed up, and I went into convulsions.
Mmm, shrimp.
Now, I don't know much about haggling or bargaining so why don't we just agree to pay whatever the Winfields want? - That could work.
- [Homer Belches] - What was that? - Sigh.
Hmm? There you are! Thought you could get away, huh? - Good-bye.
- [ Groans ] I don't think we should be down here.
Nervous, Lise? I don't blame you.
This is where the Winfields hid their mutated son.
Bart, the Winfields didn't have a son.
See that sock over there? It was his only friend.
[ Eerie Voice ] Hello, Lisa.
Here in the dark, you won't need those eyes.
- Let me have them.
- Bart, that's not funny! There are some who say the monster - is still here! - [ Screaming ] [ Laughing ] [ Erie Voice ] Friend.
Friend! [ Screaming ] [Girl] Hey, kid, wake up.
- [Bart] Who are you? - I'm Laura, your new neighbor.
You all right? [ Thinking ] She's beautiful.
Say something clever.
I fell on my bottom.
[ Thinking ] D'oh! Oh, not again! My mother's inside, Mrs.
Simpson.
Please go right on in.
Oh, you speak so politely to adults.
My upbringing was painfully strict, ma'am.
That's sweet.
[Marge]And, finally, Moe's Tavern has contributed a coupon as their way of saying "Welcome to Springfield.
'" Thank you.
This is all so nice.
I actually had some doubts about moving to Springfield especially after that Time cover story, "America's Worst City.
" - You could see our house in that photo.
- Oh.
And this is, uh, for the man of the house which I guess is you.
[ Nervous Groan ] I guess I should explain.
Laura's father and I divorced two years ago.
[ Chuckles ] They're so sweet when you marry them.
- But soon, it's just career, career, career.
- [Homer]My hammock! Do you understand? Mine! Don't look that way! [ Groans ] I bet you don't know this one.
How'd you like a Hertz donut? - [ Groans ] - Hurts, don't it? [ Chuckles ] Right.
Do you know what a wet willie is? - Is it this? - [Kearney]Hey, baby! How about puttin' your finger in my ear? Well, I don't know.
Your boyfriend looks like the jealous type.
- Hey, what the-- - That chick's messin' with our minds.
- Let's get out of here.
- Now, where were we? - Oh, yeah.
I was gonna tell your fortune.
- Huh? - Oh, man.
You're gonna be rich! - Whoa! There's your mansion.
There's the tennis court.
[ Spits ] And there's the swimming pool.
See you later, Bart.
[ Chuckles ] I'll never wash this hand again.
[Lisa] Dad, make Bart wash his hand.
Sorry, Lise.
I no longer control the hand.
- The hand controls me! - Dad! Shut up, you little monsters! Hello, I was wondering if you'd like to babysit my little angels.
Sorry, this isn't Abbie.
This is her sister.
I look after her now.
No, Bart, put it down.
Put it down, Bart.
Bart, put it down.
Oh! No all-you-can-eat seafood.
I wore my extra-loose pants for nothing.
- Nothing! - Maybe Laura could watch us.
Oh, I get it.
"Bart, the babysitter's here.
" "Let me tuck you in.
" - Silence! - [ Yells ] Huh? [ Yelling ] Maybe it's time I wash my hand.
I'll send Laura over to babysit as soon as she gets home.
Great.
Oh, uh, and there was something else.
- Something I was supposed to tiptoe around-- - My divorce.
That's it! Whoo-hoo! I'm glad one of us remembered.
That could have been embarrassing.
Well, I know what you're thinking, and the answer is yes.
I want to be fixed up with one of your friends as soon as you can arrange it.
- After all, Homer, I do have the normal appetites.
- [ Chuckles ] I know what you mean.
just let me make sure we're not talking about food.
- I'm not.
- Right.
Me neither.
- We're talking about sex, right? - Right.
I hear you loud and clear.
[ Purrs ] - Bart, are you taking a bath? - Yes, I am.
And it would be nice to have a little privacy around here for a change.
This wouldn't have anything to do with Laura coming over, would it? Hey, sometimes a guy just likes his skin to look its yellowest.
Why, Laura.
What a pleasant surprise.
Cute.
What do you guys want for dinner? I don't care.
Ask Hef over there.
Lady's choice.
Sometimes I think you want to fail! Shut up.
just shut up! - [ Ringing ] - [ Both Grunting ] We used to eat this when my dad was stationed in "Vandihar.
" Take your kaftab'Sounieh and dip it in the labneh.
Now, that is good labneh.
I'm sorry, ma'am, but everything on the menu has fish in it.
What about the bread? Does that have much fish in it? - Yes.
- Well, I have some Tic Tacs in my purse-- Excellent choice.
And for the gentleman? - All you can eat! All you can eat! - All right.
When you're ready, take this plate over-- Please, don't take the steam tray! Sir! Come on, Bart.
If I can teach Maggie to waltz, I can teach you.
[Waltz] just follow me.
Put your hand on my hip.
[ Voice Cracking ] Okay.
- Wedgie! - Whoa! [Homer Eating Loudly] [ Snoring ] That man ate all our shrimp and two plastic lobsters! 'Tis no man.
'Tis a remorseless eating machine.
Arr! - Six bells.
Time for closin'.
- Can't talk.
Eating.
Fairly warned be thee, says I.
Huh? Hey! Hey! Hey! But the sign said, "All you can eat.
" [ Groaning ] I'm gonna fight this thing.
Oh, please don't.
For me? Sorry, Marge.
This is my quest.
I'm like that guy, that Spanish guy.
- You know, he fought the windmills.
- Don Quixote? No, that's not it.
What's his name? "The Man of La Mancha.
" - Don Quixote.
- No! I really think that was the character's name-- Don Quixote.
Fine.
I'll look it up.
Well, who was it? - Never mind.
- Mm-hmm.
[ Alarm Ringing ] Oh, no! Here comes the conservative judge! [Growling] Plead insanity! Plead insanity! - It's not working! - All right.
Hit the "change of venue" button.
Now! [Bart] Oh, no.
You're in Texas! - [ Yelling ] - Yee-haw! If I'd hit the "remorse" button one more time, I would have made it.
Ah, Bart, I gotta go.
See you around.
- I am thinking you like this girl, yes? - How did you know? My ceiling mirrors and video cameras sometimes see more than who is about to shoot me.
"All you can eat.
'" Ha! Mr.
Simpson, this is the most blatant case of fraudulent advertising since my suit against the film The Neverending Story.
So, do you think I have a case? Homer, I don't use the word "hero" very often.
But you are the greatest hero in American history.
Whoo-hoo! - I'm here to see my Grampa.
- Here I am, sonny.
- You're not my grandpa.
- Ah, come on.
Give me a chance.
Hey, can your grandfather do this? [ Karate Yells ] - Oh! - Bart! Aw, you remembered my birthday.
Huh? Oh.
I sure did.
- Here's a bus schedule.
- Wow! Fits right in my pocket.
Grampa, I need some advice.
Did you ever have a crush on an older woman? I had a crush on the oldest woman.
- Here's a picture of her delivering Eubie Blake.
- What happened? She fell in with that Guinness Book of Records crowd.
Suddenly, she didn't have any time for me.
Oh! I wore a 1 5-pound beard of bees for that woman, but it just wasn't enough.
Dad, I have some questions about women.
Uh, can't you see I'm readin' the, uh, cultural calendar? Ooh! "Mostly Mozart" is in town.
Homer, Bart's at a very curious age.
As his father, I think you should have a frank and earthy discussion about you know.
But, Marge, I think he should learn about it the same way I did.
Are you sure? [ Thinking ] Hmm.
- [Monkeys Chittering] - Zookeeper! Zookeeper! Those two monkeys are killing each other! - [ Whispering ] They're having sex.
- Oh? Maybe you're right.
Now, if you'll excuse us this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father.
Son, a woman is a lot like, um a refrigerator.
They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds.
They make ice and-- Oh, wait a minute.
Actually, a woman is more like a beer.
They smell good.
They look good.
You'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one.
You wanna drink another woman.
So I says, "Yeah, if you want that money, come and find it "'cause I don't know where it is, you bologna.
You make me wanna retch.
" [ Snoring ] [ Sighs ] How can I get her to notice me? Meet me at the tree house, Bart.
And come alone.
[ Gulps ] - Thanks for coming.
- I please to aim.
I'm so happy.
I just had to tell someone.
I have a boyfriend.
You won't be needing this.
[ Groans ] A boyfriend? I really think you'd like him, Bart.
His name's Jimbo.
Jimbo Jones? - [ Grunting ] - [Knocking] Uh, you've been flushing for 20 minutes.
- Is there a problem? - [Jimbo] Uh, no, Principal Skinner.
- [Chuckling] - Very well.
I'll continue to wait.
- ## [ Humming ] - [Toilet Flushing] - ## [ Whistling ] - [Flushing Continues] How can you like that guy? I don't know.
Maybe 'cause he's an outlaw.
- You know that dead body they found behind the mayor's house? -Jimbo killed him? - No, but he poked him with a stick.
- [Moped Engine Running] Hey, Laura, Dr.
Tongue has arrived.
That's him, Bart! - Who's the dork? - Leave him alone.
He's just a kid.
[Echoing] Just a kid.
Just a kid.
I'll show them who's just a kid.
[Marge] Bart, it's your bedtime.
- I laid out your jammy-jams.
- [ Groans ] [Eating Loudly] Dad, if there's a really special girl and she likes some clod who's beneath her, what should you do? - I married her! [ Laughing ] - [ Snickering ] Homer, please.
[ Hiccups ] I just had eggs.
Good luck in your trumped-up lawsuit, Dad.
Thanks.
That means a lot to me.
All right, you guys.
I want you in bed before Jimbo gets here.
What do you like about him? He's just a good-lookin' rebel who plays by his own rules.
[ Both Sigh ] 'Twas a moonless night, dark as pitch when out of the mist came a beast more stomach than man.
- Hey! - So I says to me bosuns, "Batten down the mizzenmast.
" Captain McCallister, isn't it a fact that you're not a real captain? - Aye.
- [ All Gasping ] Your Honor, I would like to show the court just how much shrimp Mr.
Simpson ate.
Bring it in, boys! all addressed to "Santa Claus.
" You want "The People of Springfield versus Kris Kringle.
" - That's next door.
- Oh.
Mrs.
Simpson, isn't it true your husband once consumed a 1 0-pound bag of flour when no other food was available? - Yes, but it was-- - Your witness.
- Uh, there's a pizza here for-- - Right here.
Mrs.
Simpson, what did you and your husband do after you were ejected from the restaurant? We pretty much went straight home.
Mrs.
Simpson, you're under oath.
We drove around until 3:00 a.
m.
looking for another all-you-can-eat fish restaurant.
- [Spectators Murmuring] - And when you couldn't find one? - We went fishing.
[ Sobbing ] - [Spectators Gasping] Do these sound like the actions of a man who had "all he could eat"? - No! - That could've been me! Homer, I've a proposition forye, fair and true.
Come on, Marge.
Let the people see your pretty face.
Come see "Bottomless Pete," nature's cruelest mistake.
Come for the freak, stay for the food.
- Oh, he's hideous! - I heard they shaved a gorilla.
Hey, baby, my shirt's chafin' me.
- Mind if I take it off? - Well, okay.
I gotta do something! Hmm.
But it says, "Good for one free beer at Moe's.
" This is Moe's Tavern, isn't it? No, this is Bo's Cavern.
Give me my beer.
Stupid Welcome Mobile.
I knew it would ruin me! - [ Ringing ] - Yeah, just a sec.
I'll check.
Uh, Amanda Huggenkiss! Hey, I'm looking for Amanda Huggenkiss! Why can't I find Amanda Huggenkiss? [ All Laughing ] Maybe your standards are too high.
You little S.
O.
B! If I ever find out who you are, I'm gonna shove a sausage down your throat and stick starving dogs in your butt! My name is Jimbo Jones, and I live at 1 094 Evergreen Terrace.
Aha! Big mistake, pal! Ho-ho! I knew he'd slip up sooner or later.
Ah, yes.
Rusty and dull.
Barney, don't steal any beer while I'm gone.
What kind of pathetic drunk Do you take me for? [ Gasps ] Somebody spilled beer in this ashtray.
[ Slurps Loudly] Ahh.
[ Grunting, Laughing Sinisterly] Let's see.
Where is that map? Evergreen Terrace.
There it is-- F-5.
[Laughing Continues] I don't believe it.
Now my pants are chafin' me.
[ Panting ] All right, who's Jimbo Jones? - I am.
- You just made your second mistake, buddy boy! Please, dude, don't hurt me.
Oh, man.
[ Sobbing ] - That's your outlaw? - I wasn't really gonna kill ya.
I was just gonna cut ya.
[ Sobbing Continues ] Ah, forget it.
Ouch! I better go check on Barney.
Uh-oh.
My heart just stopped.
Ah, there it goes.
[ Grunting, Laughing Sinisterly] - [Thump] - Ow! Stupid wishing well! Jimbo, I don't think we should see each other anymore.
You're just not the guy I thought you were.
[ Sniffles ] Can I have my shirt back? [ Blowing Nose ] Well, Bart, you were right about him.
As usual, a knife-wielding maniac has shown us the way.
You know, if you were only old enough to grow a bad teenage mustache - I'd go out with you in a second.
- Wow.
Hello, I'd like to speak to Miss Tinkle, first name - [ Whispering ] - Ivana.
Ivana Tinkle.
just a sec.
Ivana Tinkle.
Ivana Tinkle! All right, everybody, put down your glasses.
- Ivana Tinkle.
 [Troy McClure] Live from Hawai's beautiful Molokai Island.
We're not just For lepers anymore.
It's Carnival of the Stars.
I'm your host, Troy McClure.
You may remember me from such film s as The Erotic Adventures of Hercules and Dial "M" for Murderousness.
Tonight we'll see Angela Lansbury walk on hot coals.
Excitement, she wrote.
[ Whimpering ] How could someone abuse their body that way? [ Gasps ] Moe, don't throw out that brine.
But first, a man whose inspiring battle with Percodan addiction is soon to be a movie of the week-- Krusty the Clown! I'll be played by Jimmy Smits.
[ Chortles ] Now he faces his toughest audience-- three Siberian tigers.
Simba, on the ball.
- [ Growling ] - Aaah! - [Krusty]Not the face! - Ah, they'll be chewing on him for a while.
[ Up-tempo ] Â¡Ay, ay, ay! Â¡LapolicÃ­a! Hey, Homer.
Phone call.
Hi, Homie.
It's really starting to snow.
I think you should come home.
But, Marge, Alan Thicke is throwing knives at Ricardo Montalban.
- [Man On TV]Ow.
- [Chuckles]Sorry, Ricardo.
[Man On Radio] Take it easy, folks.
It's "snow" picnic out there.
[Man #2 Chuckles] I "snow" what you mean.
[Man #1 Chuckles] You're dead weight, Marty.
- [ Yelps, Groans ] - [Crash] D'oh! Well, I got him as good as he got me.
D'oh! Now, before I give you the check, one more question.
Uh, this place, Moe's, you left just before the accident this is a business of some kind? [ Thinking ] Don't tell him you were at a bar.
[ Gasps ] But what else is open at night? It's a pornography store.
I was buying pornography.
[ Thinking ] Heh-heh-heh.
I would've never thought of that.
[ Snorts ] 'Fraid old Zeke, he rides up here with me.
Can't trust a pig with watermelons, you know.
[ Slurping ] She'll go 300 hectares on a single tank of kerosene.
What country is this car from? It no longer exists, but take her for a test-drive and you'll agree-- [ Speaking Slavic Language ] Put it in "H.
" [Homer]Kids, if we buy a new car, we get our parking validated for free.
Do you come with the car? Oh, you.
[ Giggles ] - Do you come with the car? - Oh, you.
[ Giggles ] [ Imitating Gunfire ] [ Whistling, Imitates Explosion ] Bart! That car belonged to Bonnie and Clyde.
Show a little respect.
Mm-hmm.
[ German Accent ] Our tireless safety engineers crash-test over 1 ,000 cars a year.
Hey, wait, That's not a dummy.
This exhibit is closed.
[ Gasps ] The Batmobile.
[ Gasps ] Adam West! Hey, kids.
Batman.
Dad, that's not the real Batman.
Of course I'm Batman.
- See, here's a picture of me with Robin.
- Who the hell's Robin? Oh, I guess you're only familiar with the new Batman movies.
Michelle Pfeiffer.
Ha.
The only true Catwoman is Julie Newmar, Lee Meriwether or Eartha Kitt.
And I didn't need molded plastic to improve my physique.
Pure West.
And how come Batman doesn't dance anymore? Remember the Batusi? [ Grunting ] Nice meetin' ya.
Just keep moving.
Don't make eye contact.
Ooh.
[ Gasps ] Wow! just think what I could do with that plow.
[ Chattering ] Homer, I've got to sneak these valuable artworks out of the White House but I can't get out of my driveway because of these protesters.
Mr.
President, those young people are about to get a dose of reality.
[ Screaming ] Ah, I can't afford it.
Pally, this doesn't cost money.
It makes money.
You make the payments by plowing driveways on the side.
Well, I really should discuss this with my wife.
Your wife? [ Imitates Whipcrack] What, you think I'm gonna buy a $20,000 truck just because you make that noise? [ Imitates Whipcracks ] I'll take it! I'll take it! I can't believe you bought that plow.
We can't afford it.
If you're gonna get mad at me every time I do something stupid then I guess I'll just have to stop doing stupid things.
- Good.
- Fine.
I'll never ever do another stupid thing.
Good night.
- Oh, Homie.
Didn't that hurt? - [ Weakly] No.
[Homer] Marge didn't reckon with these flyers and this flashy jacket.
[Wind Howling] [ Gasping ] - Oh! - Forget it, Homer.
People don't read these things.
Watch.
Twenty percent off at Lullabuys.
just tell 'em Big Baby sent you.
I know you can hear me.
I'm talkin' to you.
You sicken me.
I guess guys like us just can't get a break.
Well, at least I can't sink any lower.
Come back, diaper.
Come back.
Hi, Ma.
- ####[Organ] - And now, to read from the Epistles of Saint Paul Homer Simpson.
[ Clears Throat ] Dear Lord, in your infinite wisdom you know the number to call when you need a plow is Klondike 5-3226.
Homer, this is really low.
Not as low as my low, low prices.
- ####[Organ] - [ Homer Grunting ] That's Mr.
Plow.
Oh, I'm gonna lose my plow.
Dad, have you considered buying cheap commercial time on Channel 92? - Check it out.
- Arr! Ninety sea chanteys on three compact discs.
[ Singing ] Act now and get a bonus C.
D.
Hornpipe Fever.
Arr.
Hmm.
- Almost time for our commercial.
- Dad, who's watching TV at 3:1 7 a.
m.
? Alcoholics, the unemployable, angry loners.
[ Snoring ] [ Gasps ] Look! There we are! It may be on a lousy channel, but the Simpsons are on TV.
[ Gasps ] Our driveway's snowed in.
[ Together] Old Man Winter! [ Cackling ] That's right.
I fill your driveways with ice and snow.
What are you gonna do about it? Nothin'.
That's what.
- [ Grunting ] - Stop! Mr.
Plow! Get out, you lousy season.
All right.
I'm going.
My head hurts.
I have to lie down for a while.
Yea! Hello, I'm Mr.
Plow.
Are you tired of having your hands cut off by snowblowers and the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow? - Uh-huh.
- Then call Klondike 5-3226.
Call now and receive a free T-shirt.
He could still surprise ya.
But I'm a real tightwad.
Can I afford this remarkable system? Absolutely.
My prices are so low, you'll think I've suffered brain damage.
You are fully bonded and licensed by the city, aren't you, Mr.
Plow? - Shut up, boy.
- [ Growls ] - So, remember-- - ## [ Synthesizer] [ Singing ] [ Steady Beep ] [Homer] Well, John Q.
Driveway has our number.
Now we play the waiting game.
Ah, the waiting game sucks.
Let's play Hungry Hungry Hippos.
Oh, thank you, Mr.
Plow.
Now my store can remain open.
Let's do it.
We're not prisoners anymore.
We're free! We can go anywhere we want.
I'm cold and frightened.
Hmm.
Hmm.
- Hmm.
- [ Groans ] I'm afraid classes maybe canceled today.
Look! We won't miss a minute of school thanks to your father.
Say your prayers, plow boy! [ Groaning ] Mr.
Plow, for making it possible for people to get where they're going without resorting to public transportation or carpooling I give you the key to the city.
[Moe] Here you go, Mr.
Plow.
- A beer on the house.
- Wow, Moe! You didn't even give a beer to those freed Iranian hostages.
Ah, they shouldn't have been there in the first place.
But Homer is a real hero.
I wish I was a hero.
Well, wishing won't make it so.
You gotta pull up your diaper, get out there and be the best damn Barney you can be.
Here I come, world! [ Yelling ] - [Grunts] - [Crash] [Can Rattling] - How do you think he'll do, Moe? - I think he'll do just fine.
I was wrong about you buying that truck.
I'm very proud of you Mr.
Plow.
[ Chuckles ] This might sound silly, but just for a change, would you mind-- Cutting my nails? Brushing my teeth? No, no.
Could you wear the Mr.
Plow jacket? just, uh, for fun.
Oh.
[ Chuckles ] [ Singing ] [ Low Chuckle ] [ Alarm Buzzing ] Ah, white gold.
[ Gasps, Stammering ] [ Horn Blowing ] Hiya, Homer.
Say hello to the Plow King.
Barney, you stole my idea.
Don't worry, Homer.
There's nothing wrong with a little healthy competition.
[Gunshots] [ Cackling ] Well, well, If it isn't Mr.
Plow.
[ Grunting ] [ Yelling ] Hey, Plow King, save some for me.
Wow! Linda Ronstadt! [ Grunting ] Linda Ronstadt? How'd you get her? Ah, we've been looking for a project to do together for a while.
[ Country] [ Singing ] [ Burps ] How could you, Barney? After all I've done for you.
"Lachrymose is to dyspeptic as ebullient is to--" Effervescent.
All right! - Harvard, here I come.
- Psst, Barney.
- My dad's asleep.
Want a beer? - I don't know.
The S.
A.
T.
's are tomorrow.
I've got two words for you.
Mellow out, man.
- Hmm? Hmm? - All right.
Just one-- if it'll get you off my back.
Hey! Where have you been all my life? [ Sighs ] Thank you, Plow Kingaly-ding.
[ Chuckles ] Flanders, I thought I was your plowman.
Uh, Homer, why don't you plow it again? Forget it, pal.
I don't need your phony-baloney job.
I'll take your money, but I'm not gonna plow your driveway.
Mr.
West, you said there was a job for me.
There was.
When I called you-- So long, Superman.
Your secret identity is safe with me.
[ Sputters ] [Homer] Ring, damn you.
Ring.
- [ Rings ] - Mr.
Plow.
That name again is Mr.
Plow.
[ Man ] Hello, I'm calling from Delinquent Accounts at Kumatsu Motors.
Oh, you want the Mr.
Plow who plows driveways.
This is Tony Plow.
You know, from Leave It to Beaver.
Yeah.
They were gay.
- Oh, what am I gonna do? - I think you should do a new ad one that's fresh and original.
I know.
I'll do a rap.
[ Imitating Beat Box ] [ Rapping ] [ Lisa Groans ] [ Bart Groaning ] - Please.
- ## [ Ends ] - Stop it right now.
- Promise you'll never do that again.
All right.
Mr.
Simpson, I guarantee you we'll come up with a commercial that can save your business.
You know those radio ads where two people with annoying voices yammer back and forth? I invented those.
Ow! Happens all the time.
[ Singing Aria ] Dad, was that your commercial? I don't know.
The torch has been passed to a new generation of, uh snowplow people.
Come on.
Give me the key.
- These look like teeth marks.
- I thought there was chocolate inside.
- Well, why was it wrapped in foil? - It was never wrapped in foil.
Hardest hit by the blizzard is Springfield's forbidding Widow's Peak.
Our own Arnie Pie is on the scene.
Everything's snowed in.
All I can see is white.
Arnie, please.
The ski conditions.
Mayday, Mayday.
I think I'm flying into a mountain.
Tell my wife I love-- [ Chuckles ] That's great, Arnie.
Hmm.
[ Disguises Voice ] Hello.
Plow King? I was wondering if you could plow my driveway on top of forbidding Widow's Peak.
I don't know.
I'd be up there all day.
I wouldn't be able to plow any other driveways.
There's a $1 0,000 bill in it for you.
Oh, yeah? Which president's on it? Uh, all of them.
They're having a party.
jimmy Carter's passed out on the couch.
Wow! I'll be right there.
Barney, I'd like to put a Spanish version Of your jingle on my next album.
[ Singing In Spanish ] Yeah, you do that.
Well, I guess you can plow my driveway.
But I wonder what happened to the Plow King.
Well, I guess he just doesn't respect his customers.
Oh, could you make sure not to scrape my asphalt.
[ Softly] Kiss my asphalt.
So I says, "Kiss my asphalt.
" Hmm? Hmm? Springfield's beloved Plow King is trapped.
- [ All Gasp ] - Barney Gumble, shown here donating $50,000 to the Shelbyville Dance Theater was caught in a sudden avalanche on Widow's Peak earlier today.
It was captured on film by a camera crew making the upcoming Fox special In Search of Bigfoot.
[ Man ] Hold it, Bob.
We can see your wristwatch.
- Oh, damn it.
- Hey, what's that? - [ Burps ] - [Rumbling] Aaah! This is all my fault.
I've gotta save him.
Homie, please, don't go.
Hey, this old girl's as sure-footed as a mountain goat.
[ Baaing ] - [Thudding] - [Baaing] - [Loud Thud] - [Weak Baa] [ Groans ] D'oh! Oh! [ Gasping, Yelling ] [Whimpering] Easy.
Easy.
[ Inhales Deeply, Sighs ] Ah, dying's not so bad.
I'll be reunited with my loved ones-- my dad and that plant I never watered.
[Rumbling] Barney! Homer, you saved my life, and I'm not gonna forget it.
From now on, we'll be partners.
Barney, that's great.
When two best friends work together not even God himself can stop them.
[Booming Male Voice] Oh, no? The snow's melted.
We can go outside again.
I don't like the looks Of those teenagers.
Could this record-breaking heat wave be the result of the dreaded greenhouse effect? Well, if70Â° days in the middle of winter are the price of car pollution you'll forgive me if I keep my old Pontiac.
[ Chuckles ] - [ Rings ] - Y'ello.
[ Man ] Hello.
This is the Repo Depot.
I'm just calling to distract you while we repossess your plow.
Oh, yeah? How dumb do you think I-- - Oh.
- Oh, now, Homie, you have your health you have your best friend back and you do have that certain special something.
- You mean-- - Mm-hmm.
[ Singing Suggestively] Our forecast calls for flurries of passion followed by extended periods of gettin' it on.
followed by extended periods of gettin' it on.

Maggie, can you say "ba-ba"? - Can you say "Mama"? - Can you say "get bent"? - Bart! - Mr.
Rogers says it all the time.
- He does not.
- Maggie, can you say "Daddy"? Daddy.
- Kitty.
Kitty.
- Be-bop.
Be-bop.
Shove it.
Shove it.
- [ Belches ] - Did you hear that? She said "burlap".
I don't think so.
Oh, Maggie, when are you going to talk? Well, don't push her.
Remember 'Tis better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.
" [ Thinking ] What does that mean? You better say something, or they'll think you're stupid.
Takes one to know one! Swish! According to Fretful Mother Magazine if Maggie doesn't talk by age one we should consider a corrective tongue extender.
- Hey, what was my first word? - Uh, well-- [Marge Snickering] Whoa! - [Homer Chuckling] Yes.
- Oh.
Â¡Aye carumba! You know, I don't think I remember.
But the story of Lisa's first word is very cute.
- [ Lisa, Bart ] Tell it, Mom.
- Yeah, tell it, Mom.
Well, this story begins in that unforgettable spring of 1 983.
Ms.
Pac-Man struck a blow for women's rights.
A young Joe Piscopo taught us how to laugh.
Before Lisa was born, we lived in a tiny apartment on the Lower East Side of Springfield.
Chipwich for sale! Chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin! Chipwich for sale! - Youse guys wanna play stickball? - Soitenly.

[ Chuckles ] - Why, you little-- - [ Groaning ] [ Snoring ] - [ Yells ] - Aah! [ Shrieking Happily] [Homer] Ah, he'll tire himself out soon.
[ Yelling Continues ] Then the prince and the princess got married and lived happily ever after.
- Then what happened? - Uh-- They had 30 sons and 30 daughters.
- What were their names? - [ Groans ] Dennis, Brianna Mavis, Brad-- [ Snoring ] No, this is true.
The Coast Guard arrested Boy George for scraping the barnacles off his dinghy.
- [Laughing] - [Audience Laughing] - Hi-yo! - [ Laughs ] Hi-yo! [ Chuckles ] Got your nose.
Got your wallet.
- [ Flushing ] - No! Bart, don't you ever do that again.
Understand? - Beep.
- [ Growls ] Guess what, Homie? There's going to be twice as much love in this house as there is now.
- We're gonna start doin' it in the morning? - No! - Oh.
- We're going to have another baby.
Marge, that's-- - Bye-bye, keys.
- [ Flushing ] [ Yelling ] Hear that, Bart? You're going to have a little brother or sister to play with.
- [ Gasps ] Who did this? - Baby.
- Bad baby.
- [ Chuckles ] [ Gasps ] Uh-oh.
I'm afraid we're going to need a bigger place.
No, we won't.
I've got it all figured out.
The baby can have Bart's crib and Bart can sleep with us until he's 21 .
- Won't that warp him? - My Cousin Frank did it.
You don't have a Cousin Frank.
He became Francine back in '76.
Then he joined that cult.
I think his name is Mother Shabubu now.
[ Groaning ] That afternoon, we left Bart with my sisters and went house-hunting.
Hey, Bart, want a dollar? Ah, ah, ah.
You know what I wanna hear.
[ Singing Children's Songs ] - Oh, yeah.
- Love that spout medley.
[Man] Now, Mr.
And Mrs.
Simpson the only houses I have in your price range are in the neighborhood colorfully referred to as the "Rat's Nest.
" - [Siren Wailing] - [Gunfire] This one just came on the market.
- Oh, dear! - [ Forced Chuckle ] Now, here we have beautiful Hardwood floors, track lighting-- [ Sniffing ] What's that stench? Once you get used to the smell of melted hog fat you'll wonder how you ever did without it.
- Mmm.
Hog fat.
- Let's keep looking.
[ Sniffs ] Ooh.
Do you smell something? Arr! Why buy a house when ye can buy a houseboat? Excuse me.
[ Yells ] Don't forget to check out the galley.
That's real shag carpeting.
Arr! [Cats Meowing] Once we get the cats out, it won't be too bad.
Actually, according to the will, the cats own the house.
You'd be their tenants.
- [ Screeching ] - [ Gasps ] I wish we lived in the kitty house.
I could've trained them to be my unholy army of the night.
Go, my pretties.
Kill! Kill! We were about to give up, when we found a house that was perfect.
Just imagine what we can do with this place.
Wow.
How much? How much? Well, here's what they're asking.
Oh, I can't afford that! - Dad, I have a problem.
- Why'd you come to me? I don't know nothin'.
I used to get by on my looks.
Now they're gone, withered away like an old piece of fruit.
[ Sobbing ] - Are you done? - No, not yet.
I was voted the handsomest boy in Albany, New York.
Dad, I don't need advice.
I need $1 5,000 to buy a home.
Oh! Well, all I own is this house that I built with my own two hands.
You didn't build this house.
You won it on a crooked '50s game show.
I ratted on everybody and got off scot-free.
Ha-ha! All right, son.
I'll sell this dump and write you a check.
Dad, first you gave me life.
Now you've given me a home for my family.
I'd be honored If you came to live with us.
Thank you.
So how long before you shipped Grampa off to the old folks' home? - About three weeks.
- [ All Laughing ] Maggie, I'll give you this cookie If you talk.
What? What? D'oh! All right, you win round seven.
When are we gonna get to my first word? - Your what what? - My first word! Eh, you don't wanna hear that story.
I know! I'll tell you about the time I got locked in the bank vault with Mr.
Mooney.
- It was another one of my harebrained schemes.
- Dad! Wait a minute.
That was The Lucy Show.
Okay, where were we? Mom was preggers, and Dad just threw all our money down the sinkhole.
Ah, yes.
I remember the day we moved in.
[ Straining ] Hey, Homer, this house sucks.
Bart, I told you not to use that word.
Call me "Daddy".
- Homer.
[ Blows Raspberry] - [Growls] - [ Gasping ] - Bart! [ Grunting ] [ Singing ] Buenos dÃ­as, neighboritos.
The handle's Flanders, but my friends call me Ned.
- Hi, Flanders.
- Who the hell are you? My name's Todd.
Would you be my friend? You're funny.
[ Chuckles ] - If you need anything, just give a whistle.
- I could use a TV tray.
- Well, gee, I-- - What? I just this minute bought it at the hardware-- - You said anything.
- [ Chuckles ] Well, sure, you can borrow it for a little while.
And that "little while" is now eight years and counting.
[ Chuckles ] Anyway, Bart had just entered the terrible twos.
[ Singing Loudly] Hello? Honey? Honey, honey, honey? Could you please be quiet? [ Singing Loudly] Bart, get out! [Homer]It's not easy to juggle a pregnant wife and a troubled child but some how I managed to fit in eight hours of TV a day.
[Theme] [ Screaming ] [ Both Laughing ] Hey, kids! [ Laughing ] Summer's just around the corner, and Krusty Burger is the official meat-flavored sandwich of the 1 984 Olympics! [ Straining ] Coochy coochy coo! - Krusty funny.

Let's go, Marge.
Leave the baby with his little crib.
- [ Yelling ] - [ Straining ] [Hammering] Ah.
Homer J.
Simpson, you're a genius.
I know you like clowns, so I made you this bed.
Now you can laugh yourself to sleep.
[Creepy Voice] If you should die before you wake-- [ Crazed Laughter] Can't sleep.
Clown'll eat me.
Can't sleep.
Clown'll eat me.
[ Male Announcer] Oh, Doctor! We are seconds away from the hundred-meter butterfly.
And with the East German-- [ Chuckles ] women shaving their backs the Americans are heavy favorites.
[ Stomach Growling ] Patience, my pet.
- [Gunshot] - And the Americans jump out to an early lead.
- [ Coughing ] - [ Female Announcer] Although we should point out that many of the other women represent countries that don't have swimming pools.
[Male Announcer] Boohoo! You're breakin' my heart.
Homie, I think the baby's coming.
Wow.
A baby and a free burger.
Could this be the best day of my life? Coming up next, an hour-long episode of Mama's Family.
Yes! We'll take good care of your boy, Simpson.

- No, I don't.
- ## [ Singing Gospel ] Where? Ouch! Ouch! Pa, can ya help me with my sums? - [ Screams ] - Oh, Bart, you met Grandma Flanders.
- Hope she didn't scare ya.
- Hello, Joe! [ Panting ] Little Lisa.
I've already started you a college fund at Lincoln Savings and Loan.
According to this magazine, Bart might be jealous of her.
Yeah, well, Bart can kiss my hairy yellow butt.
From now on, the baby sleeps in the crib.
- Iron helps us play! - [ Crazed Laughter] - Hello, Joe! - From now on, the baby sleeps in the crib.
- Iron helps us play! - [ Crazed Laughter] - Hello, Joe! - [Homer]Bart? There's someone in here who wants to meet you.
[ Yawning, Cooing ] Well, Bart, what do you think of little Lisa? I hate you.
I saved this newspaper from the day Lisa was born.
"Mondale to Hart: Where's the Beef?" "Where's the beef?" What the hell's that supposed to mean? [ Laughing ] "Where's the beef?" No wonder he won Minnesota.
Everyone agreed that Lisa was a beautiful baby.
Here she is! [ Coughing ] Isn't that cute? She's coughing.
Aw.
I'm gonna give her a kiss.
- I know a new song.
- You still here? [ Singing In French, Badly] Um, uh-- ## [ Starts Over] You already sang that part.
The older they get, the cuter they ain't.
Hey, the baby just spit up.
[Baby Talk] [Male Announcer] Welcome back to the final day of this-- the 23rd Olympiad, brought to you by Krusty Burger.
You people are pigs! [ Sobbing ] I personally am gonna spit in every 50th burger.
- I like those odds.
- [Announcer]In a moment we'll look at the courageous Korean gymnast Kim Huyang who made a perfect dismount on what was later revealed to be a broken leg.
- [ Bone Snaps ] - [ Screaming ] [ Chuckling ] Ouch! But first, let's go to the boxing venue.
Please, please, please, please, please! [ Howard Cosell ] The American, Drederick Tatum does a triumphant turkey trot over the supine Swede.
One's thoughts turn to Alexander of Macedon's victory at Granicus and Issus.
[ Chattering ] U.
S.
A! U.
S.
A! U.
S.
A! Carl Lewis, I could kiss you! [ Chuckling ] She has the reflexes of a young Mary Lou Retton.
- Have a "wowwipop.
" - Can I have a lollipop? Oh, Bart, I'm afraid that was the last one.
But I've got something even better for you-- a rubella inoculation.
[ Chuckling ] [ Humming Lullaby] I wanna hold the baby.
I wanna hold the baby.
I'm sorry, Bart.
You're too little.
Here, Bart, you can hold my beer.
- Homer! - What? Good night, honey.
Hello, Lisa.
Lisa, time for your feed-- [ Screaming ] Who's cuter now? She started it.
[ Giggling ] Stupid mailman.
Squeal on me.
- [Doorbell Rings] - Hidey-ho, Simpson.
Your son shoved this through our doggie door.
And since we're returning your second-born you think you could see your way to returning my TV tray-- Boy, you get over to the corner and you-- Yeah.
I liked it when it was me, Mom and Homer.
You wrecked everything.
I'm leaving.
Good-bye.
- Bart.
- What did you say? - Bart? - Sufferin' succotash! - You can talk! - Goo.
Mom, Dad, she can talk! Say it again, Lise.
- Bart.
Bart, Bart, Bart, Bart, Bart.
- I'm her first word! Well, I'm not surprised.
Lisa's crazy about you.
She thinks you hung the moon.
Wow! Lisa, can you say "Mommy"? - Mommy.
- Can you say "David Hasselhoff"? Dave Hassahoff.
[ Chuckles ] - Can you say "Daddy"? - Homer.
- No, sweetie.
"Daddy".
- Homer.
- D'oh! - [ Both Laughing ] - I was sitting there! - I don't see your name on it.
- It's right there.
- Bart, don't write on the rug.
Ha-ha.
Mom yelled at you.
- Did not.
- Did too.
You know, Maggie, the sooner kids talk, the sooner they talk back.
I hope you never say a word.
Daddy.
